# Profile helper

Profile helper offers two functions:

1. Find a profile for kids
2. Compare two profiles or profile switches in order to clone a new profile

## Profile for kids (up to 18 years)

**Important note:**

**Profile helper is intended to support you finding the initial profile for your kid. Even though it is based on data sets of two different hospitals always discuss with your medical team before using a new profile!**

Profile helper offers data sets from two different hospitals for children to find initial profile for your kid up to 18 years.

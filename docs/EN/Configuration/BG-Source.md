## For users of Eversense<br>
The easiest way to use Eversense with AndroidAPS is to install the modified [Eversense app](https://github.com/BernhardRo/Esel/blob/master/apk/mod_com.senseonics.gen12androidapp-release.apk) (and unistall the original one first). 

**Warning: by uninstalling the old app, your local historical data older than one week will be lost!**

To finally get your data to AndroidAPS, you need to install [ESEL](https://github.com/BernhardRo/Esel/blob/master/apk/esel.apk) and enable "Send to AAPS and xDrip" in ESEL and "MM640g" as BG source in the [Configuration Builder](../Configuration/Config-Builder.md) in AndroidAPS. As the BG data from Eversense can be noisy sometimes, it is good to enable "Smooth Data" in ESEL, which is better than enabling "Always use short average delta instead of simple delta" in AAPS.

You can find another instruction for using xDrip with an Eversense [here](https://github.com/BernhardRo/Esel/tree/master/apk).

## For users of MM640g or MM630g<br>
* If not already set up then download [600SeriesAndroidUploaer](http://pazaan.github.io/600SeriesAndroidUploader/) and follow instructions on [Nightscout](http://www.nightscout.info/wiki/welcome/nightscout-and-medtronic-640g).
* In 600 Series Uploader go to Settings > Send to xdrip+ and select ON (tick).
* Select MM640g in ConfigBuilder (setting in AndroidAPS).

## For users of PocTech CT-100<br>
* Install PocTech App
* Select PocTech App in ConfigBuilder (setting in AndroidAPS).

## For users of other CGM uploaded to Nightscout<br>
If you have any other CGM set up that sends your data to [Nightscout](http://www.nightscout.info) then<br>
* In AndroidAPS Preferences enter your Nightscout website and API secret.
* Select NSClient in ConfigBuilder (setting in AndroidAPS).

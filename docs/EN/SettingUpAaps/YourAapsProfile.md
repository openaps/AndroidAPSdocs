# Your **AAPS** profile

Your **AAPS** profile is a set of five key parameters which define how **AAPS** should deliver insulin in response to your sensor glucose levels. **AAPS** has several _additional_ modifiable parameters (like SMB settings), but using these well relies on your underlying **AAPS** profile being correct. The **AAPS** profile incorporates: 
* [duration of insulin action](#duration-of-insulin-action-dia) (DIA),
* [glucose targets](#glucose-targets),
* [basal rates](#basal-rates) (BR),
* [insulin sensitivity factors](#insulin-sensitivity-factor-isf) (ISF) and
* [insulin-to-carb ratios](#insulin-to-carb-ratio-icr) (IC or ICR). 

The four last parameters can be set to different values, changing hourly if required, over a 24-hour period. Please note, the sample profile below shows a large number of timepoints. When you start out with **AAPS**, your profile is likely to be much simpler.

```{admonition} Your diabetes may vary
:class: information
Profiles vary significantly from person-to-person.

For the final three parameters, basal rates (BR), insulin sensitivity factors (ISF) and insulin-to-carb ratios (IC or ICR), the absolute values and trends in your insulin requirements vary significantly from person to person, depending on your biology, gender, age, fitness level etc. as well as shorter term factors like illness and recent exercise. For more guidance on this, the book [“Brights Spots and Landmines”](https://brightspotsandlandmines.org/Bright_Spots_and_Landmines_by_Adam_Brown.pdf) by Adam Brown is an excellent book to read.

Screenshots from **AAPS** of an _example_ profile are shown in below.

## Duration of insulin action (DIA)

The duration of insulin action is set to a single value in **AAPS**, because your pump will continually infuse the same type of insulin. 

In combination with the [insulin type](#Config-Builder-insulin), this will result in the [insulin profile](#AapsScreens-insulin-profile). Read more there to help you define a proper DIA.

## Glucose targets

The **figure below** shows an example of how the DIA and glucose targets could be set in an **AAPS** profile.

![24-07-23, profile basics - DIA and target](../images/f3904cc3-3d9e-497e-a3b6-3a49650053e6.png)

Your **BG target** is a core value and all of **AAPS** calculations are based on it. It is different from the target range which you usually aim to keep your blood glucose values in:
* A glucose target, particularly if it is only short-term (less than 4 hours in duration), does not need to be the *actual value* you expect or want your glucose level to get to, rather, it is a good way to tell **AAPS** to be more or less aggressive, while still keeping your glucose levels in range.
* If your target is very wide (say, 3 or more mmol/l [50 mg/dl or more] wide), you will often find little **AAPS** action. This is because **BG** level is predicted to be somewhere in that wide range, and thus temporary basal rate changes are rarely suggested.
* When beginning with **AAPS**, especially when progressing through [the first objectives](../SettingUpAaps/CompletingTheObjectives.md), using a wide range target can be a good option while you are learning how **AAPS** behaves and ajusting your **Profile**.
* Later on, you will probably find more appropriate to reduce the range until you have a single target for each time of the day (_Low_ target = _High_ target), to make sure that **AAPS** reacts promptly to **BG** fluctuations.

The targets can be defined within those boundaries :

|         | _Low_ target           | _High_ target          |
|---------|------------------------|------------------------|
| Minimum | 4 mmol/l or 72 mg/dL   | 5 mmol/l or 90 mg/dL   |
| Maximum | 10 mmol/l or 180 mg/dL | 15 mmol/l or 225 mg/dL |

Glucose targets are set according to your personal preferences. For example, if you are concerned about hypos at night, you may set your target slightly higher at 117/mg/dL (6.5 mmol/L) from 9 pm - 7am. If you want to make sure you have plenty of insulin on board (IOB) in the morning before bolusing for breakfast, you may set a lower target of 81 mg/dL (4.5 mmol/L) from 7 am - 8 am.

## Basal rates

Your basal rate of insulin (Units/hour) provides background insulin, keeping your glucose levels stable in the absence of food or exercise. 

Accurate basal rates enable you to wake up in range, and to skip meals - or eat - earlier or later in the day, without going high or low. The insulin pump delivers small amounts of rapid acting insulin every few minutes, to keep the liver from releasing too much glucose, and to move glucose into body cells. Basal insulin usually makes up between 40 - 50% of your total daily dose (TDD), depending on your diet, and typically follows a circadian rhythm, with one peak and one valley in insulin requirements over 24 hours. For more information, chapter 23 of [“Think like a Pancreas”](https://amzn.eu/d/iVU0RGe) by Gary Scheiner is very useful. 

Most type 1 diabetes educators (and people with type 1 diabetes!) agree that you should work on getting your basal rates correct, before attempting to optimise your ISF and ICR. 
 
## Insulin sensitivity factor (ISF)

The insulin sensitivity factor (sometimes called correction factor) is a measure of how much your blood glucose level will be reduced by 1 unit of insulin. 

**In mg/dL units:** 
If you have an ISF of 40, each unit of insulin will reduce your blood glucose by approx. 40 mg/dL (for example, your blood glucose will fall from 140 mg/dL to 100 mg/dL). 

**In mmol/L units:** 
If you have an ISF of 1.5, each unit of insulin will reduce your blood glucose by approx. 1.5 mmol/L (for example from 8 mmol/L to 6.5 mmol/L). 

From these examples you can see that the _smaller_ the ISF value, the less sensitive you are to insulin. So if you reduce your ISF from 40 to 35 (mg/dl) or 1.5 to 1.3 (mmol/L), this is often called strengthening your ISF. Conversely, increasing the ISF value from 40 to 45 (mg/dl) or 1.5 to 1.8 mmol/L) is weakening your ISF. 

If your ISF is too strong (small value) it will result in hypos, and if it is too weak (large value), it will result in hyperglycemia.  

A basic starting point for determining your daytime ISF is to base it on your total daily dose (TDD) using the 1,700 (94) rule. More detail is given in Chapter 7 of [“Think like a Pancreas”](https://amzn.eu/d/iVU0RGe) by Gary Scheiner.

1700 (if measuring in mg/dl) or 94 (mmol/L)/ TDD = approx ISF. 

Example: TDD = 40 U
Approx ISF (mg/dl) = 1700/40 = 43
Approx ISF (mmol/L) = 94/40 = 2.4

See the **figure below** for an example of how the basal rates and ISF values could be set in an **AAPS** profile.

## Insulin to Carb ratio (ICR)
  
The ICR is a measure of how many grams of carbohydrate are covered by one unit of insulin.

Some people also use I:C as an abbreviation instead of ICR, or talk about carb ratio (CR). 

For example, a 1-to-10 (1:10) insulin-to-carb ratio means that you take 1U of insulin for every 10 grams of carbs eaten. A meal of 25g carbs would need 2.5U of insulin.

If your ICR is weaker, perhaps 1:20, you would only need 0.5U of insulin to cover 10 g of carbs. A meal of 25g of carbs would need 25/20 = 1.25U of insulin.  

It is common to have different ICR at different times of day due to hormone levels and physical activity. Many people find they have their lowest ICR around breakfast time. So, for example, your ICR could be 1:8 for breakfast, 1:10 for lunch and 1:10 for dinner, but these patterns are not universal, and some people are more insulin resistant at dinner time, and require a stronger/smaller ICR then. 

As shown in the **figure below**, when entering these values into an **AAPS** profile, we just enter the final part of the ratio, so an insulin-to-carb ratio of 1:3.5 is entered simply as “3.5”.

## About the importance of getting your profile right

**Why should I try to get my profile settings right? Can’t the loop just take care of it?**

A hybrid closed loop _can_ attempt to make insulin delivery adjustments to minimise poor glycemic control that results from having incorrect profile values. It can do this, for example, by withholding insulin delivery if you are going to hypo. However, you can achieve much better glycemic control if your profile settings are already as close as possible to what your body needs. This is one of the reasons that **AAPS** uses staged objectives to move from open loop pumping towards hybrid closed loop. In addition, there will be times when you need to open the loop (sensor warmups, sensor failure _etc._), sometimes in the middle of the night, and you will want to have your settings right for these situations. 

If you are starting with **AAPS** after using a different open or closed-loop pumping system, you will already have a reasonable idea of what values to use for basal rates (BR), insulin sensitivity factors (ISF) and insulin-to-carb ratios (IC or ICR). 

If you are moving from injections (MDI) to **AAPS**, then it is a good idea to read up on how to make the transfer from MDI to pump first, and plan and make the move carefully in consultation with your diabetes team.

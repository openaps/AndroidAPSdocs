# How to translate AndroidAPS

* Go to [https://translations.androidaps.org](https://translations.androidaps.org) or [https://wikitranslations.androidaps.org](https://wikitranslations.androidaps.org) and login using your Github account

* Contact [Milos](https://gitter.im/MilosKozak) or [Adrian](https://gitter.im/AdrianLxM) and specify language and if you want to be a translator or proofreader (only people skilled in translating + advanced AndroidAPS users)

* When we approve you, click the flag ![](../images/translation-flags.png)

* Click strings.xml ![](../images/translations-click-strings.png)

* Translate sentences on left side by adding new translated text or use & edit suggestion ![](../images/translations-translate.png)

* Proofreaders have to switch to Proofreading mode ![](../images/translations-proofreading-mode.png) 
* and approve translated texts ![](../images/translations-proofreading.png)

When a proofreader approves a translation it will be added to the next version of AndroidAPS. In the beginning it would be good to also go over the existing translations that are not yet approved and check for mistakes or approve them if they are correct.

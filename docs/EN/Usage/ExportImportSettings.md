# Export & import settings

## When should I export settings?

Be prepared for the unforeseen. You might change important settings by accident and have problems to undo the changes. Your phone might break or get stolen. To easily return to status you've been at, settings should be exported on a regular basis.

Best practice is to export after change of settings or completing an objective.

Exported settings should be copied to a cloud storage or your computer, better two different locations. So you are prepared for loss or damage of your AAPS phone and do not have to start from zero.

On a Windows 10 computer it looks like this:

```

## Exported information

Among others the following information is part of the settings export:

- [Automation](../Usage/Automation.md) events
- [Config builder](../Configuration/Config-Builder.md) settings
- [Local profile](../Configuration/Config-Builder.md#local-profile) settings
- [Objectives](../Usage/Objectives.md) status incl. [exam results](../Usage/Objectives.md#objective-3-prove-your-knowledge)
- [Preferences](../Configuration/Preferences.md) incl. [NS Client settings](../Configuration/Preferences.md#nsclient)

## Encrypted backup format

Settings backup is encrypted by a master password that can be set in [Preferences](../Configuration/Preferences.md#master-password) .

### Note for Dana RS users

- As pump connection settings are also imported AAPS on your new phone will already "know" the pump and therefore not start a bluetooth scan.
- Please pair new phone and pump manually.

### Import settings from previous versions (before AAPS 2.7)

- The "old" settings file (called 'AndroidAPSPreferences' - without file extension) must be in root folder of your smartphone (/storage/emulated/0).
- Do not put the "old" file in the same folder as the new exported settings (AAPS/preferences).
- You will find the "old" file on the bottom of the list in the import dialogue.

## Transfer settings file

- Best way to transfer settings file to a new phone is via USB cable or cloud service (i.e. Google Drive).
- Manuals can be found on the web, i.e. [Android help pages](https://support.google.com/android/answer/9064445?hl=en).
- If you experience problems with the transferred file try another way to transfer file.

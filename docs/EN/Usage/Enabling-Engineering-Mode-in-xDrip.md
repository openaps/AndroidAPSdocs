Enabling Engineering Mode in xDrip+ activates extended and experimental features within the app.

To enable Engineering Mode, on the xDrip+ home screen tap the Treatment icon on the right side of the screen (this resembles a syringe). Then tap and hold the microphone icon on the bottom-right of the Treatment interface. In the text field that opens, type "enable engineering mode" and click Done. Engineering Mode is now enabled.

* **Install AndroidAPS** on the new phone.
* **Import settings** on your new phone
  * Hamburger menu (top left corner of screen)
  * Maintenance
  * Import settings
* **Note for Dana RS users:**
  * As pump connection settings are also imported AAPS on your new phone will already "know" the pump and therefore not start a bluetooth scan. Please pair new phone and pump manually.

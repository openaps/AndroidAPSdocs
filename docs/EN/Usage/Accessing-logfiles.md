# Accessing logfiles

* Connect phone to a computer in file transfer mode
* Locate log files in this directory or similiar (may little bit vary on different phones)

* The current log is a .log file which can be viewed in a number of ways such as [LogCat](https://developer.android.com/studio/debug/am-logcat.html) in Android Studio, Log Viewer android app, or simply plain text. Previous log files are zipped and stored in folders in date/time order.  If sharing your log in [gitter](https://gitter.im/MilosKozak/AndroidAPS) when talking about a potential bug then unzip and upload the folder dated before the error occurred.

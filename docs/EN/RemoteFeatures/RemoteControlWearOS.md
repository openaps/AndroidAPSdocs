# Operation of AAPS via your Wear OS smartwatch

(Watchfaces-aaps-watchfaces)=

## AAPS Watchfaces

```{warning}
AAPS Watchfaces are available for Wear OS smartwatches with API level 28 to 33.
Wear OS 5 changes locked the watchfaces: only complications can be used.
```

There are several watchfaces to choose from that are included in the base build of the AAPS Wear APK. These watchfaces include average delta, IOB, currently active temp basal rate and basal profiles and a CGM readings graph.

Some available actions on the watchfaces are:

* Double tap on the BG to get to the AAPS menu
* Double tap on the BG graph to change the graph's time scale

## Configuration

Enable the Wear module in the [Config Builder](../SettingUpAaps/ConfigBuilder.md).

Use the Wear Preferences to define which variables should be considered when calculating bolus given though your watch (i.e. 15min trend, COB...).

If you want to bolus etc. from the watch then within "Wear settings" you need to enable "Controls from Watch".

![Wear settings](../images/ConfBuild_Wear.png)

Through Wear tab or hamburger menu (top left of screen, if tab is not displayed) you can

* Resend all data.
  Might be helpful if watch was not connected for some time, and you want to push the information to the watch.
* Open settings on your watch directly from your phone.

Ensure notifications from AAPS are not blocked on the watch. Confirmation of an action (e.g. bolus, tempt target) comes via a notification which you will need to swipe and tick.

## Accessing main menu of AAPS

To access main menu of AAPS you can use on of following options:

* double tap on your BG value
* select AAPS icon in watch applications menu
* tap on AAPS complication (if configured for menu)

## Settings (in wear watch)

To access to the watchface settings, enter AAPS main menu, slide up and select "Settings".

Filled star is for enabled state (**On**), and hollow star icon indicates that setting is disabled (**Off**):

(Watchfaces-complications)=

## Complications

_Complication_ is a term from traditional watchmaking, where it describes addition to the main watchface - as another small window or sub-dial (with date, day of the week, moon phase, etc.). Wear OS 2.0 brings that metaphor to allow custom data providers, like weather, notifications, fitness counters and more - to be added to any watchfaces that support complications.

AAPS Wear OS app supports complications since build `2.6`, and allow any third party watchface that supports complications to be configured to display AAPS related data (BG with the trend, IOB, COB, etc.).

Complications also serve as **shortcut** to AAPS functions. By tapping them you can open AAPS related menus and dialogs (depending on complication type and configuration).

![Complications_On_Watchfaces](../images/Watchface_Complications_On_Watchfaces.png)

### Complication Types

AAPS Wear OS app provides only raw data, according to predefined formats. It is up to third-party watchface to decide where and how to render complications, including its layout, border, color, and font. From many Wear OS complication types available, AAPS uses:

* `SHORT TEXT` - Contains two lines of text, 7 characters each, sometimes referred to as value and label. Usually rendered inside a circle or small pill - one below another, or side by side. It is a very space-limited complication. AAPS tries to remove unnecessary characters to fit-in: by rounding values, removing leading and trailing zeroes from values, etc.
* `LONG TEXT` - Contains two lines of text, about 20 characters each. Usually rendered inside a rectangle or long pill - one below another. It is used for more details and textual status.
* `RANGED VALUE` - Used for values from predefined range, like a percentage. It contains icon, label and is usually rendered as circle progress dial.
* `LARGE IMAGE` - Custom background image that can be used (when supported by watchface) as background.

### Complication Setup

To add complication to watchface, configure it by long press and clicking the gear icon below. Depending on how specific watchface configures them - either click on placeholders or enter the watchface setup menu for complications. AAPS complications are grouped under the AAPS menu entry.

When configuring complications on watchface, Wear OS will present and filter the list of complications that can be fit into selected complication place on watchface. If specific complications cannot be found on the list, it is probably due to its type that cannot be used for the given place.

### Complications provided by AAPS

AAPS provides following complications:

![AAPS_Complications_List](../images/Watchface_Complications_List.png)

* **BR, CoB & IoB** (`SHORT TEXT`, opens _Menu_): Displays _Basal Rate_ on the first line and _Carbs on Board_ and _Insulin on Board_ on the second line.
* **Blood Glucose** (`SHORT TEXT`, opens _Menu_): Displays _Blood Glucose_ value and _trend_ arrow on the first line and _measurement age_ and _BG delta_ on the second line.
* **CoB & IoB** (`SHORT TEXT`, opens _Menu_): Displays _Carbs on Board_ on the first line and _Insulin on Board_ on the second line.
* **CoB Detailed** (`SHORT TEXT`, opens _Wizard_): Displays current active _Carbs on Board_ on the first line and planned (future, eCarbs) Carbs on the second line.
* **CoB Icon** (`SHORT TEXT`, opens _Wizard_): Displays _Carbs on Board_ value with a static icon.
* **Full Status** (`LONG TEXT`, opens _Menu_): Shows most of the data at once: _Blood Glucose_ value and _trend_ arrow, _BG delta_ and _measurement age_ on the first line. On the second line _Carbs on Board_, _Insulin on Board_ and _Basal Rate_.
* **Full Status (flipped)** (`LONG TEXT`, opens _Menu_): Same data as for standard _Full Status_, but lines are flipped. Can be used in watchfaces which ignores one of two lines in `LONG TEXT`
* **IoB Detailed** (`SHORT TEXT`, opens _Bolus_): Displays total _Insulin on Board_ on the first line and split of _IoB_ for _Bolus_ and _Basal_ part on the second line.
* **IoB Icon** (`SHORT TEXT`, opens _Bolus_): Displays _Insulin on Board_ value with a static icon.
* **Uploader/Phone Battery** (`RANGED VALUE`, opens _Status_): Displays battery percentage of AAPS phone (uploader), as reported by AAPS. Displayed as percentage gauge with a battery icon that reflects reported value. It may be not updated in real-time, but when other important AAPS data changes (usually: every ~5 minutes with new _Blood Glucose_ measurement).

Additionally, there are three complications of `LARGE IMAGE` kind: **Dark Wallpaper**, **Gray Wallpaper** and **Light Wallpaper**, displaying static AAPS wallpaper.

### Complication related settings

* **Complication Tap Action** (default `Default`): Decides which dialog is opened when user taps complication:
  * _Default_: action specific to complication type _(see list above)_
  * _Menu_: AAPS main menu
  * _Wizard_: bolus wizard - bolus calculator
  * _Bolus_: direct bolus value entry
  * _eCarb_: eCarb configuration dialog
  * _Status_: status sub-menu
  * _None_: Disables tap action on AAPS complications
* **Unicode in Complications** (default `On`): When `On`, the complication will use Unicode characters for symbols like `Δ` Delta, `⁞` vertical dot separator or `⎍` Basal Rate symbol. Rendering of them depends on the font, and that can be very watchface-specific. This option allows switching Unicode symbols `Off` when needed - if the font used by custom watchface does not support those symbols - to avoid graphical glitches.

(WearOsSmartwatch-wear-os-tiles)=

## Wear OS Tiles

Wear OS Tiles provide easy access to users' information and actions to get things done. The tiles are only available on Android smartwatches running on Wear Os version 2.0 and higher.

Tiles allow you to quickly access actions on the AAPS application without going through the watch face menu. The tiles are optional and can be added and configured by the user. 

The tiles are used "next to" any watch face. To access a tile, when enabled, swipe right to left on your watch face to show them. 

Please note; that the tiles do not hold the actual state of the AAPS phone app and will only make a request, which has to be confirmed on the watch before it is applied.


## How to add Tiles

Before using the tiles, you have to switch on "Control from Watch" in the "Wear OS" settings of Android APS.

![Wear phone preferences enabled](../images/wear_phone_preferences.jpg)

Depending on your Wear OS version, brand and smartphone there are two ways of enabling the tiles:

1. On your watch, from your watch face;
   - Swipe right to left till you reach the "+ Add tiles" 
   - Select one of the tiles.
2. On your phone open the companion app for your watch. 
   - For Samsung open "Galaxy Wearable", or for other brands "Wear OS"
   - In the click on the section "Tiles", followed by "+ Add" button
   - Find the AAPS tile you like to add by selecting it.
     ![Wear phone add tile](../images/wear_companion_app_add_tile.png)
   - The order of the tiles can be changed by dragging and dropping

The content of the tiles can be customized by long-pressing a tile and clicking the "Edit" or "gear icon" button.


### APS(Actions) Tile

The action tile can hold 1 to 4 user-defined action buttons. To configure, long-press the tile, which will show the configuration options. Similar actions are also available through the standard watch menu.

Actions supported in the Action tile can request the AAPS phone app for:

* **Calc**; do a bolus calculation, based on carb input and optional a percentage [1]
* **Insulin**; request insulin delivery by entering the unit of insulin
* **Treatment**; request both insulin delivery and add carbs
* **Carbs**; add (extended) carbs
* **TempT**; set a custom temporary target and duration

![Wear action tile, sample calculator](../images/wear_actions.png)

[1] Via, the Wear OS menu, set the "Calculator Percentage" option to "ON" to show the percentage input in the bolus calculator. The default percentage is based on the phone settings in the "Overview" section ["Deliver this part of the bolus wizard result %"](#Preferences-deliver-this-part-of-bolus-wizard-result) When the user does not provide a percentage, the default value from the phone is used. Configure the other parameters for the bolus calculator in the phone app via "Preferences" "Wizard Settings".


### AAPS(Temp Target) Tile

The Temp Target Tile can request a temporary target based on AAPS phone presets. Configure preset time and targets through the phone app setting by going to "Preferences", "Overview", ["Default Temp-Targets"](#Preferences-default-temp-targets)  and set the duration and targets for each preset. Configure the visible actions on the tile through the tile settings. Long press the tile to show the configuration options and select 1 to 4 options:

* **Activity**; for sport
* **Hypo**; to raise the target during hypo treatment
* **Eating soon**; to lower the target to raise the insulin on board
* **Manual**; set a custom temporary target and duration
* **Cancel**; to stop the current temporary target

![Wear actions tile edit](../images/wear_tile_tempt_edit.png)


### AAPS(QuickWizard)Tile

The QuickWizard tile can hold 1 to 4 quick wizard action buttons, defined with the phone app[2]. See [QuickWizard](#Preferences-quick-wizard). You can set standard meals (carbs and calculation method for the bolus) to be displayed on the tile depending on the time of the day. Ideal for the most common meals/snacks you eat during the day. You can specify if the quick wizard buttons will show on the phone, watch, or both. Please note that the phone can show only one quick wizard button at a time. The quick wizard setup also can specify a custom percentage of the insulin for the bolus. The custom percentage enables you to vary, for example, snack at 120%, slow absorbing breakfast 80% and hypo treatment sugar snack at 0%

![Wear actions tile and phone configuration](../images/quickwizard_watch_phone.png)

[2] Wear OS limits tiles update frequency to only once every 30 seconds. When you notice that the changes on your phone are not reflected on the tile, consider; waiting 30 seconds, using the "Resend all data" button from the Wear OS section of AAPS, or removing the tile and adding it again. To change the order of the QuickWizard buttons dragging an item up or down.


## Always on

Long battery life for Android Wear OS smartwatches is a challenge. Some smartwatches get as much as 30 hours before recharging. The display should be switched off for optimal power saving when not in use. Most watches support the “Always on” display.

Since AAPS version 3, we can use a “Simplify UI” during always-on-mode. This UI only contains the blood glucose, direction, and time. This UI is power-optimized with less frequent updates, showing less information and lightening fewer pixels to save power on OLED displays.

The simplified UI mode is available for the watch-faces: AAPS, AAPS V2, Home Big, Digital Style, Steampunk, and Cockpit. The simplified UI is optional and is configured through the watch face settings. (log press the watch face and click “edit” or the gear icon) Select the configuration “Simplify UI" and set it to “Always on” or “Always on and charging”.

### Night-time mode

While charging, it would be helpful if the display could stay “always-on” and show your blood glucose during the night. However, the standard watch-faces are too bright and have too much information, and the details are hard to read with sleepy eyes. Therefore, we added an option for the watch-face to simplify the UI only during charging when set in the configuration.

The simplified UI mode is available for the watch-faces: AAPS, AAPS V2, Home Big, Digital Style, Steampunk, and Cockpit. The simplified UI is optional and is configured through the watch face settings. (log press the watch face and click “edit” or the gear icon) Select the configuration “Simplify UI" and set it to “During charging” or “Always on and charging”

The Android developer options enable your watch to stay awake during charging. To make the developer options available, see the [official documentation](https://developer.android.com/training/wearables/get-started/debugging). Set the “Stay awake when charging” to “on” in the developer options”.

Note: not all displays can handle always-on very well. It can cause screen burn-in, especially on the older OLED displays. The watches will generally dim the display to prevent burn-in; please check your owner’s manual, the manufacturing, or the internet for advice.

## Snooze Alert shortcut

It is possible to create a shortcut to snooze the alerts/alarm of AAPS. Muting the sound via your watch is convenient and faster without reaching for your phone. Note; you still have to check your alarm message on your phone and handle it accordingly,  but you can check that later. When your watch has two buttons, you can assign a key to the `AAPS Snooze Alert` program.

To link the button on the Samsung Watch 4 go to `Settings > Advanced Features > Customize Buttons > Double press > AAPS Snooze Alert`

### Snooze xDrip

When you use xDrip and have xDrip installed on the watch, the 'AAPS Snooze Alert' shortcut will also Snooze any xDrip alarm. 


## Performance and battery life tips

Wear OS watches are very power-constrained devices. The size of the watch case limits the capacity of the included battery. Even with recent advancements both on hardware and software side, Wear OS watches still require daily charging.

If an experienced battery span is shorter than a day (from dusk to dawn), here are some tips to troubleshoot the issues.

Main battery-demanding areas are:

* Active display with a backlight on (for LED) or in full intensity mode (for OLED)
* Rendering on screen
* Radio communication over Bluetooth

Since we cannot compromise on communication (we need up-to-date data) and want to have the most recent data rendered, most of the optimizations can be done in _display time_ area:

* Stock watchfaces are usually better optimized than custom one, downloaded from the store.
* It is better to use watchfaces that limit the amount of rendered data in inactive / dimmed mode.
* Be aware when mixing other Complications, like third party weather widgets, or other - utilizing data from external sources.
* Start with simpler watchfaces. Add one complication at the time and observe how they affect battery life.
* Try to use **Dark** theme for AAPS watchfaces, and [**Matching divider**](#watchface-settings). On OLED devices it will limit the amount of pixels lit and limit burnout.
* Check what performs better on your watch: AAPS stock watchfaces or other watchfaces with AAPS Complications.
* Observe over a few days, with different activity profiles. Most watches activate the display on glancing, movement and other usage-related triggers.
* Check your global system settings that affect performance: notifications, backlight/active display timeout, when GPS is activated.
* Check [list of tested phones and watches](#Phones-list-of-tested-phones) and [ask community](../GettingHelp/WhereCanIGetHelp.md) for other users experiences and reported battery lifetime.
* **We cannot guarantee that data displayed on watchface or complication is up-to-date**. In the end, it is up to Wear OS to decide when to update a watchface or a complication. Even when the AAPS app requests update, the System may decide to postpone or ignore updates to conserve battery. When in doubt and low on battery on watch - always double-check with main AAPS app on phone.

(Watchfaces-troubleshooting-the-wear-app)=

## Troubleshooting the wear app:

*  Sometimes it helps to re-sync the apps to the watch as it can be a bit slow to do so itself: Android Wear > Cog icon > Watch name > Resync apps.
*  Enable ADB debugging in Developer Options (on watch), connect the watch via USB and start the Wear app once in Android Studio.
*  If Complications does not update data - check first if AAPS watchfaces work at all.

## Additional AAPS custom watchfaces are also available

[Here](../ExchangeSiteCustomWatchfaces/index.md) you can download Zip-Files with custom watchfaces made by other users.

## Build your own watchface

If you want to build your own watchface, follow the [guide here](../ExchangeSiteCustomWatchfaces/CustomWatchfaceReference.md).

Once you have built a custom watchface, you can share your own **AAPS** custom watchface with others, the zip-file can be uploaded in the folder  "ExchangeSiteCustomWatchfaces" via a Pull Request into Github. During merge of the pull request, the documentation team will extract the CustomWatchface.png file and prefix it with the filename of the Zip-file.

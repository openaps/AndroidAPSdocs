# General CGM recommendations

## CGM hygiene

Whichever CGM system you are using, if you are going to use blood based
calibration, then there are some very clear rules you should apply,
whether or not you are using DIY CGM software or the official apps.

-   Make sure hands and kit are clean.
-   Try to calibrate when you have a series of dots with a flat arrow
    (15-30 minutes is usually enough)
-   Avoid calibrating when glucose levels are moving up or down.
-   Do “enough” calibrations – on official apps, you will be prompted
    for once or twice per day checks. On DIY systems you may not be, and
    should be careful about continuing without calibrations.
-   If it all possible, calibrate with some of your readings in a lower
    range (4-5mmol/l or 72-90mg/dl) and some at a slightly higher level
    (7-9mmol/l or 126-160mg/dl) as this provides a better range for the
    point/slope calibration.

## Setting sensor (G6)

When setting sensor, it is recommended not to press the inserter too
firmly in order to avoid bleeding. The sensor thread should not come
into contact with blood.

After setting the sensor, the transmitter can be clicked into the sensor
holder. Caution! First click in the square side and then press down the
round side.

## Troubleshooting

### Connection problems

Bluetooth connection may be disturbed by other nearby Bluetooth devices
such as blood glucose meters, headsets, tablets or kitchen devices such
as microwave ovens or ceramic hobs. In this case xdrip does not display
any BG values. When bluetooth connection is restabilised the data is
backfilled.

### Sensor Errors

If recurring sensor errors occur try selecting a different body site to
set your sensor. The sensor thread should not come into contact with
blood.

Often a "Sensor Error" can be corrected by immediate drinking and
massage around the sensor!

### Jumpy values

You might try to change settings for noise blocking in xdrip (Settings -
Inter-App Settings - Noise Blocking) i.e. "Block Very High noise and
worse". See also [Smoothing BG
data](../Usage/Smoothing-Blood-Glucose-Data-in-xDrip.md).

### Negative Sensor Age

![Negative sensor age](../images/Troubleshooting_SensorAge.png)

This occurs if there is either a double "CGM Sensor Insert" entry in
[actions tab / menu](../Configuration/Config-Builder.md#actions) or a
sensor insert with wrong date. Go to treatments tab \> careportal and
delete the wrong entry.

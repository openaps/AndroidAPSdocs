# Estoy atascado; ¿Qué hago? ¿A quién puedo preguntar?

Este proyecto se basa en trabajo voluntario por lo que algunas reglas se aplican para evitar el trabajo extra a quienes tan amablemente donan su tiempo y habilidades:

* nivel 1: leer la Wiki - ahora tenemos una función de búsqueda para ayudarle!
* level 2: Search the Facebook group, if there is not already an answer then ask your question in the [AndroidAPS Users Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/1900195340201874/)
* level 3: If facebook did not get results then ask in [gitter](https://gitter.im/MilosKozak/AndroidAPS). Direct crossposts will be ignored/deleted on both channels to save duplicate answers. Don't forget that the majority of developers are in Europe so the response may not be 24/7; you may have to wait for several hours especially over weekends and holidays.
* level 4: Create an [issue](https://github.com/MilosKozak/AndroidAPS/issues) and attach your [log files](../Usage/Accessing-logfiles.html)
* level 5: email <developers@androidaps.org> (only if personal data is involved that should not go in a public channel and your problems have not been resolved in the other levels)

For support on CGM sources please use the Facebook groups or gitter channels for that specific system (e.g. [xdrip](https://www.facebook.com/groups/xDripG5/), [600 series uploader](https://www.facebook.com/groups/NightscoutForMedtronic/)) or support on Nightscout use [CGMintheCloud](https://www.facebook.com/groups/cgminthecloud/) as the users there will have a greater level of expertise than the people here who all use different systems.

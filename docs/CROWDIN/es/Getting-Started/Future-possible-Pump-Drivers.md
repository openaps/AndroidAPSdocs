# Posibles (futuros) drivers para Bombas

Esta es la lista de algunas Bombas que se van mencionando por ahí, y el grado de soporte a las mismas en cualquiera de los sistemas de Lazo cerrado y, a continuación, su situación respecto en AAPS. Al final hay alguna información, de lo que se requiere para que una bomba pueda ser utilizada para "Lazos Cerrados".

## Bombas compatibles

* * *

### EOPatch2 ([Homepage](http://www.eoflow.com/eng/main/main.html))

**Loop status:** Is a hot Loop candidate. The remote control they use is actually modified Android device. (Pump is currently available only in Korea). Without commitment look out for AndroidAPS 3.2.

**Requisitos de hardware para AAPS: ** Probablemente ninguno. It seems to be BT enabled.

### Ypsomed Pump ([Homepage](https://www.ypsomed.com/en/diabetes-care-mylife.html))

**Loop status:** Version 1 - 1.5 (2Q/2018) are not Loop candidates. While they do have BT communication, communication is very limited and uni directional: Pump->App. In June 2022 (in Germany) company released, new version nicknamed DOSE (1.6), which allows setting bolus and TBR from their App. This pump is slowly getting available around Europe, but it will take some time to be available everywhere. Plan to implement their own Loop was cancelled and they decided to partner up with CamAPS (support already implemented) and use their loop solution. More info see this [page](https://www.mylife-diabetescare.com/en/loop-program.html)

**Hardware requirement for AAPS:** None. Está habilitada para BT.

**Comments:** There are currently 2 groups working on driver, so after new version is released, we can expect to have AAPS support soon thereafter. One group is being supported by YpsoMed and helping with Medical trials that are happening in Australia, 2nd is working independently by reverse engineering original app.

### Kaleido ([Homepage](https://www.hellokaleido.com/))

**Loop status:** Currently not supported by any of loop system. Pump is a Loop candidate, but since protocol is unknown at the time, I am not seeing this pump supported very soon.

**Requisitos de hardware para AAPS: ** Probablemente ninguno. Está habilitada para BT.

* * *

### Medtrum A6/P6/C6 ([Homepage](https://www.medtrum.com/product/nanopump.html))

**Loop status:** Is a Loop candidate. Company has its own limited half-Loop system running (A6). Controllable via iPhone App. No Android app available at the moment.

**Requisitos de hardware para AAPS: ** Probablemente ninguno. It seems to be BT enabled.

* * *

### Accu-Chek Solo ([Homepage](https://www.roche.com/media/releases/med-cor-2018-07-23.htm))

**Loop status:** Is a Loop candidate.

**Hardware requirement for AAPS:** None. It seems to be BT enabled.

**Comments:** There are some developers looking into decoding the protocol, but so far this is only in preliminary phases.

### Tandem: t:slim X2 ([Homepage](https://www.tandemdiabetes.com/))

**Loop status:** Not yet loopable.

While in the past company has decided not to allow their pumps to be controlled by external devices, it seems that last few years have been a game changer. Company decided to upgrade their t:slim X2 pump to be able to be controlled remotely (via t:connect app), which means that avenues are opened that we might be able to look forward to have control of pump via AAPS in the future. New pump firmware is planned to be released soon (this or next year, before their tubeless pump t:sport comes out). There are no details yet, what operations will be possible from t:connect (Bolus definitely, everything else unknown).

**Hardware requirement for AAPS:** None. It seems to be BT enabled.

* * *

### Tandem: t:Mobi & t:slim X3 & t:Mobi Tubeless ([Homepage](https://www.tandemdiabetes.com/about-us/pipeline))

**Loop status:** All 3 pumps will be Loop candidates.

They plan to release t:Mobi first (previously called t:sport) at end of 2022 or in 2023. Afterwards they will release t:slim X3 (2023 maybe) and after that t:Mobi Tubeless. t:mobi's will be controlable only over phone app, while X3 will look similar as X2, with some new nifty features (remote update of firmware, remote control over phone app, etc).

**Hardware requirement for AAPS:** None. It seems to be BT enabled.

### Medtronic Bluetooth

**Comments:** This is pump that will come out in next few years and is planned to be supported in Tidepool Loop software ([see this article](https://www.tidepool.org/blog/tidepool-loop-medtronic-collaboration).

### Willcare Insulin pump ([Homepage](http://en.shinmyungmedi.com))

**Loop status:** At the moment its not Loop candidate, but we were contacted by their staff and they interested in extending their pump to be loopable (at the moment I think its missing only get/set profile commands).

**Hardware requirement for AAPS:** None. It seems to be BT enabled.

**Comments:** Since company is interested in integration with AAPS, they might do implementation themselves.

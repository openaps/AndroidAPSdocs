# Posibles (futuros) drivers para Bombas

Esta es la lista de algunas Bombas que se van mencionando por ahí, y el grado de soporte a las mismas en cualquiera de los sistemas de Lazo cerrado y, a continuación, su situación respecto en AAPS. Al final hay alguna información, de lo que se requiere para que una bomba pueda ser utilizada para "Lazos Cerrados".

## Bombas compatibles

### Kaleido ([Homepage](https://www.hellokaleido.com/))

**Loop status:** Pump is a Loop candidate, but protocol is unknown at the time. No interest in open source from the vendor.

**Hardware requirement for AAPS:** None. It seems to be BT enabled.

### Tandem: t:slim X2 ([Homepage](https://www.tandemdiabetes.com/))

**Loop status:** Not yet loopable.

While in the past company has decided not to allow their pumps to be controlled by external devices, it seems that last few years have been a game changer. Company decided to upgrade their t:slim X2 pump to be able to be controlled remotely (via t:connect app), which means that avenues are opened that we might be able to look forward to have control of pump via AAPS in the future. New pump firmware is planned to be released soon (this or next year, before their tubeless pump t:sport comes out). There are no details yet, what operations will be possible from t:connect (Bolus definitely, everything else unknown).

**Hardware requirement for AAPS:** None. It seems to be BT enabled.

### Tandem: t:Mobi & t:slim X3 & t:Mobi Tubeless ([Homepage](https://www.tandemdiabetes.com/about-us/pipeline))

**Loop status:** All 3 pumps will be Loop candidates.

Awaiting release of t:mobi in Europe (other two are not yet released anywhere). Development of AAPS t:mobi support has already started and should be available by end of 2025 (see more info on Discord).

**Hardware requirement for AAPS:** None. It seems to be BT enabled.

### Willcare Insulin pump ([Homepage](http://shinmyungmedi.com/en/))

**Loop status:** At the moment its not Loop candidate, but we were contacted by their staff and they interested in extending their pump to be loopable (at the moment I think its missing only get/set profile commands).

**Hardware requirement for AAPS:** None. It seems to be BT enabled.

**Comments:** Since company is interested in integration with AAPS, they might do implementation themselves.

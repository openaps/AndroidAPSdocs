# Dexcom G7 and ONE+


## Fundamental in advance

Noteworthy is the fact that the G7 and ONE+ systems, compared to the G6, do not smooth the values, neither in the app, nor in the reader. More details about this [here](https://www.dexcom.com/en-us/faqs/why-does-past-cgm-data-look-different-from-past-data-on-receiver-and-follow-app).

:class: warning
**Exponential Smoothing** **MUST** be enabled for meaningful use of the G7 / ONE+ values.  
```

## 1.  Patched Dexcom G7 App (DiAKEM)

**Note: AAPS 3.2.0.0 or higher is required! Not available for ONE+.**

### Install a new patched (!) G7 app and start the sensor

A patched Dexcom G7 app (DiAKEM) gives access to the Dexcom G7 data. This is not the BYODA app as this app can not receive G7 data at the moment.

Uninstall the original Dexcom app if you used it before (A running sensor session can be continued - note the sensor code before removal of the app!)

Download and install the patched.apk [here](https://github.com/authorgambel/g7/releases).

Enter sensor code in the patched app.

Follow the general recommendations for CGM hygiene and sensor placement found [here](../Hardware/GeneralCGMRecommendation.md).

After the warm-up phase, the values are displayed as usual in the G7 app.

### Configuration in AAPS

For the configuration in AAPS
- Select 'BYODA' in in [ConfigBuilder, BG Source](../Configuration/Config-Builder.md#bg-source) - even if it is not the BYODA app!

- If AAPS does not receive any values, switch to another BG source and then back to 'BYODA' to invoke the query for approving data exchange between AAPS and BYODA.

## 2. xDrip+ (direct connection to G7 or ONE+)

- Follow the instructions here: [Xdrip+ G7](https://navid200.github.io/xDrip/docs/Dexcom/G7.html)
- Select  xDrip+ in [ConfigBuilder, BG Source](../Configuration/Config-Builder.md#bg-source).

- Adjust the xDrip+ settings according to the explanations on the xDrip+ settings page  [xDrip+ settings](../Configuration/xdrip.md)

## 3. xDrip+ (companion mode)

-   Download and install xDrip+: [xDrip](https://github.com/NightscoutFoundation/xDrip)
- As data source in xDrip+ "Companion App" must be selected and under Advanced Settings > Bluetooth Settings > "Companion Bluetooth" must be enabled.
-   Select  xDrip+ in in [ConfigBuilder, BG Source](../Configuration/Config-Builder.md#bg-source).

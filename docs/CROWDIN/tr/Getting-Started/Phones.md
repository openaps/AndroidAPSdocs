The current version of **AAPS** (3.3) requires an Android smartphone with Google **Android 11.0 or above**. If you are considering buying a new phone, (as of December 2024), **Android 14 is preferred**.

As of November 2024, several users have reported issues with Android 15 and Omnipod Dash Bluetooth connection.

Since June 2025, many users report not being able to start Omnipod Dash with Android 16.

You may wish to delay the updates, especially if you are using Omnipod Dash.

Check [Facebook or Discord](../GettingHelp/WhereCanIGetHelp.md) for latest updates on this subject.

Users are strongly encouraged to keep their build of **AAPS** up to date for safety reasons. However, for users unable to use a device with Android 11.0 or newer, earlier versions of **AAPS** compatible for older Android versions, remain available, see: [Release notes](#maintenance-android-version-aaps-version).

## List of tested Phones

We maintain a list of the [tested hardware setups](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/1/d/e/2PACX-1vScCNaIguEZVTVFAgpv1kXHdsHl3fs6xT6RB2Z1CeVJ561AvvqGwxMhlmSHk4J056gMCAQE02sAWJvT/pubhtml?gid=683363241&single=true).

This list provides user feedback on the usage of a phone along with **AAPS** and a given pump and CGM. It can help you check if your phone / pump / CGM has been used successfully by other users.

The document is read-only. With CRTL-F, you can search in the text of the Google sheet.

To record your test of a hardware setup, please fill in this [form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfoGKLYEx4aUAJ5RWL3xLJeNdmRyxtXmDzpGhuU3Rfcj2H_Jw/viewform). After you fill in the form data, the sheet is updated automatically every 5 minutes

Any problems with the spreadsheet, please contact its maintainer, *@theodoor5137*, on Discord, or see the [Where can I get help? page](../GettingHelp/WhereCanIGetHelp.md).

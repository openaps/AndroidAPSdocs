# Update to a new version or branch

## Build yourself instead of download

**AAPS** is not available to download, due to regulations concerning medical devices. It is legal to build the app for your own use, but you must not give a copy to others! See [FAQ page](../Getting-Started/FAQ.md) for details.

## Important notes

* Please update to the new version of **AAPS** as soon as possible after a new release is available.
* When a new release is available, in the **AAPS** app itself, you will receive an information banner about the new version.
* The new version will also be announced on Facebook at the time of release.
* Following the release, please read the [Release Notes](../Installing-AndroidAPS/Releasenotes.md) in detail, and clarify any queries with the community on Facebook or Discord, before proceeding with the update.
* You need to use version **[Hedgehog (2023.1.1) or Iguana (2023.2.1)](https://developer.android.com/studio/)** of Android Studio. If your version is older, please update first Android Studio first!

## 3. Build the Signed APK

Your sourcecode is now the current released version. It's time to build the signed apk from it as described in the [build signed apk section](Building-APK-generate-signed-apk).

## 4. Transfer the apk

You need to transfer the apk to your phone so you can install it.

See the instructions for [Transfer APK to smartphone](Building-APK-transfer-apk-to-smartphone)

## 5. Install apk

On your phone you have to allow installation from unknown sources. Manuals how to do this can be found on the internet (i.e. [here](https://www.expressvpn.com/de/support/vpn-setup/enable-apk-installs-android/) or [here](https://www.androidcentral.com/unknown-sources)). Note: If you completed the build with the same existing key store in Android Studio, then you do not need to remove the existing app on your phone. When you install the apk, follow the prompts to install updates. For other scenarios such as establishing a new key store in Android Studio for your signed apk, you will need to delete the old app before installing the apk.

## 6. Check AAPS version on phone

After you installed the new apk, you can check the AAPS version on your phone by clicking the three dots menu on the top right and then About. You should see the current version.

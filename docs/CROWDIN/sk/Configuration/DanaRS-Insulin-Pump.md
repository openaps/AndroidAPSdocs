# DanaRS Pump

*These instructions are for configuring the app and your pump if you have a DanaRS from 2017 onwards. Visit [DanaR Insulin Pump](./DanaR-Insulin-Pump) if you have the original DanaR instead.*

**New Dana RS firmware v3 can be used from AndroidAPS version 2.7 onwards.**

* In DanaRS pump "BASAL A" is used by the app. Existing data gets overwritten.

## Pairing pump

### Default password

* For DanaRS with firmware v1 and v2 the default password is 1234.
* For DanaRS with firmware v3 the default password is a combination of production month and production date (i.e. month 01 and day 24). Open main menu on pump > review > information. Number 3 is production date.

* **You have to confirm the pairing on the pump!** That's just the way you are used to from other bluetooth pairings (i.e. smartphone and car audio).

## Dana RS specific errors

### Error during insulin delivery

In case the connection between AAPS and Dana RS is lost during bolus insulin delivery (i.e. you walk away from phone while Dana RS is pumping insulin) you will see the following message and hear an alarm sound.

![Alarm insulin delivery](../images/DanaRS_Error_bolus.png)

* In most cases this is just a communication issue and the correct amount of insulin is delivered.
* Check in pump history (either on the pump or through Dana tab > pump history > boluses) if correct bolus is given.
* Delete error entry in [treatments tab](../Getting-Started/Screenshots#carb-correction) if you wish.
* Real amount is read and recorded on next connect. To force this press BT icon on dana tab or just wait for next connect.

## Special note when switching phone

When switching to a new phone the following steps are neccessary:

* [Export settings](../Usage/ExportImportSettings#export-settings) on your old phone
* Transfer settings from old to new phone
* **Manually pair** Dana RS with the new phone
    
    * As pump connection settings are also imported AAPS on your new phone will already "know" the pump and therefore not start a bluetooth scan. Therefore new phone and pump must be paired manually.
* Install AndroidAPS on the new phone.
* [Import settings](../Usage/ExportImportSettings#import-settings) on your new phone

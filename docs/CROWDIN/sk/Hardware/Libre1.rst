Freestyle Libre 1
**************************************************

To use your Libre as a CGM that is getting new BG values every 5 minutes you first need to buy a NFC to Bluetooth adapter like:

* MiaoMiao Reader (version 1 or 2) `https://www.miaomiao.cool/ <https://www.miaomiao.cool/>`_
* Blucon Nightrider `https://www.ambrosiasys.com/our-products/blucon/ <https://www.ambrosiasys.com/our-products/blucon/>`_
* Bubble `https://bubbleshop.eu/ <https://bubbleshop.eu/>`_

Additionally it is possible to use a specific watch, the Sony Smartwatch 3 which has an NFC chip which can be enabled and can be used as a NFC collector. However the custom NFC to Bluetooth adapters listed above offer a less complex solution and would be used by the majority of those wanting to use their Libre 1 as a CGM.

As it currently stands, if using Libre 1 as BG source you cannot activate ‘Enable SMB always’ and ‘Enable SMB after carbs’ within the SMB algorithm. The BG values of Libre 1 are not smooth enough to use it safely. See `Smoothing blood glucose data <../Usage/Smoothing-Blood-Glucose-Data-in-xDrip.html>`_ for more details.

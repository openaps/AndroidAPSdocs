# Tidepool

Tidepool is a third party tool that collects data regarding BG, insulin and carbs and can be used to analyze and share this data with your clinical team. As of AAPS version 3.2 it can be used as an alternative to Nightscout for satisfying part of Objective 1. It can also be used in combination with Nightscout as an alternative reporting platform that integrates well with clinical settings. This may be the desired option for children using AAPS who want to have the remote monitoring and control capabilities of Nightscout, but want a reporting platform that their clinical team are more comfortable with.

It is important to understand the tidepool is for reporting only. It is NOT a real-time follow app. If you need to have followers apart from the main AAPS phone you must setup Nightscout as well.

Note: the Tidepool organization is also working on bringing the iOS Loop product to market with FDA approval. This effort has nothing to do with their data reporting platform or AAPS.

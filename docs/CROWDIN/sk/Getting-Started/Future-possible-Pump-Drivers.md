# Future (possible) Pump Drivers

This is list of some Pumps floating around there, and status of support for them in any of Looping systems and then status in AAPS. On end there is some info, what is required for a pump to be "Loop capable".

## Pumps whose support is in development

### Medtronic

**Loop status:** Some of older versions of pumps are loopable, but not the newer models (see below)

**Other implementations:** OpenAPS, Loop

**Java implementations:** Partial implementation available [Rountrip2](https://github.com/TC2013/Roundtrip2), and [RileyLinkAAPS](https://github.com/andyrozman/RileyLinkAAPS)

**AAPS implementation status:** Work in progress. See [Andy's AndroidAPS fork](https://github.com/andyrozman/AndroidAPS), branch medtronic_andy. Most of work was done on [RileyLinkAAPS](https://github.com/andyrozman/RileyLinkAAPS) to get framework and commands working. There is project (Medtronic) and tickets opened for future development on that repository, development is being done on branch dev_medtronic (which is default branch there). There is also gitter room: RileyLinkAAPS/Lobby. AAPS. 0.10 test "release" is out, with about 95% of all functionality, at the moment what is missing is synhronization of TBRs and Pump "Delivery stopped" events. Project will probably be merged to main repository by end of July 2019. For details and timing see [Project board](https://github.com/andyrozman/RileyLinkAAPS/projects/1).

**Hardware requirement for AAPS:** RileyLink (with 916 MHz antenna).

**Loopable versions:** 512-522, 523 (Fw 2.4A or lower), 554 (EU firmware 2.6A or lower, CA firmware 2.7A or lower). Same for 7xx versions. All other devices are not supported, and probably won't be.

### Insulet Omnipod (with "old" Eros Pods) ([Homepage](https://www.myomnipod.com/en-gb/about/how-to-use))

**Loop status:** Not supported natively by AAPS at the moment. Decoding of the Omnipod protocol is finished- [OpenOmni](http://www.openomni.org/) and [OmniAPS Slack](https://omniaps.slack.com/)

**Other implementations:**

- Omnipy for AndroidAPS (stable in testing, requires Raspberry Pi as well as RileyLink, and specially modified AndroidAPS) [Omnipy](https://github.com/winemug/omnipy)
- OmniCore for AndroidAPS (not release yet, C# code running "natively" on Android, requires only RileyLink and specially modified AndroidAPS - next version of Omnipy project). [OmniCore](https://github.com/winemug/OmniCore)
- Loop (stable, released, requires RileyLink). [Loop](https://loopkit.github.io/loopdocs/)

**Java implementations:** None till now.

**AAPS implementation status:** Work on a native Java driver for Omnipod on AAPS is progressing on [AAPS-Omnipod/AndroidAPS](https://github.com/AAPS-Omnipod/AndroidAPS) (omnipod_eros branch). It does not require a Raspberry Pi. You can follow progress on [the OmniAPS Slack](https://omniaps.slack.com/) on channel android-driver. A first public test version is expected to be released around January 2020.

**Hardware requirement for AAPS:** RileyLink with Omnipod firmware (2.x) and 433 MHz antenna.

## Pumps that are Loopable

### Omnipod DASH ([Homepage](https://www.myomnipod.com/DASH))

**Loop status:** Currently not supported by any of loop system. Pump is a Loop candidate, but protocol unknown at the moment. Selling of pump officially started in January 2019.

**Hardware requirement for AAPS:** Probably none. It's BT enabled.

**Comments:** We are looking into development of Omnipod DASH, but problem at the moment is, that Dash is not yet available in Europe (where most of AAPS developers are) and that communciation protocol is unknown. We will try to reverse engineer official Dash APK, to determine how communication works and then implementation based on that findings. You can follow what is happening here: [DashAAPS](https://github.com/andyrozman/DashAAPS/projects/1), but don't expect this to be available anytime soon. This is at the moment only Proof Of Concept (until Milestone 2 is completed).

### Ypsomed Pump ([Homepage](https://www.ypsomed.com/en/diabetes-care-mylife.html))

**Loop status:** Version 1 - 1.5 (2Q/2018) are not Loop candidates. While they do have BT communication, it seems that communication is very limited (uni directional: Pump->App). Maybe this will change in the next versions.

**Hardware requirement for AAPS:** Probably none. It's BT enabled.

* * *

### Kaleido ([Homepage](https://www.hellokaleido.com/))

**Loop status:** Currently not supported by any of loop system. Pump is a Loop candidate, but since protocol is unknown at the time, I am not seeing this pump supported very soon.

**Hardware requirement for AAPS:** Probably none. It's BT enabled.

* * *

### Medtrum A6/P6/C6 ([Homepage](http://www.medtrum.com/P6.html))

**Loop status:** Is a Loop candidate. Company has its own limited half-Loop system running (A6). Controlable via iPhone App. No Android app available at the moment.

**Hardware requirement for AAPS:** Probably none. It seems to be BT enabled.

* * *

### EOFLOW ([Homepage](http://www.eoflow.com/eng/main/main.html))

**Loop status:** Is a Loop candidate. The remote control they use is actually modified Android device. (Pump is currently available only in Korea).

**Hardware requirement for AAPS:** Probably none. It seems to be BT enabled.

### Accu-Chek Solo ([Homepage](https://www.roche.com/media/releases/med-cor-2018-07-23.htm))

**Loop status:** Is a Loop candidate. Pump will start selling at end of 2018 in selected countries in EU. Its rummored to have Android app for control.

**Hardware requirement for AAPS:** Probably none. It seems to be BT enabled.

### Medtronic Bluetooth

**Comments:** This is pump that will come out in next few years and is planned to be supported in Tidepool Loop software ([see this article](https://www.tidepool.org/blog/tidepool-loop-medtronic-collaboration).

## Pumps no longer sold (companies no longer operating)

### Cellnovo Pump ([Homepage](https://www.cellnovo.com/en/homepage))

**Loop status:** Currently not supported by any of loop system. Pump is a Loop candidate, but since protocol is unknown at the time, I am not seeing this pump supported very soon.

**Hardware requirement for AAPS:** Probably none. It's BT enabled.

**Note about product:** It seems that company decided to exit the Pump Business. You can see more in this [article](https://diabetogenic.wordpress.com/2019/04/01/and-then-cellnovo-disappeared/?fbclid=IwAR12Ow6gVbEOuD1zw7aNjBwqj5_aPkPipteHY1VHBvT3mchlH2y7Us6ZeAU)

## Pumps that aren't Loopable

### Tandem:(any) ([Homepage](https://www.tandemdiabetes.com/))

**Loop status:** Not loopable.

While ago they had firmware called T:AP (mentioned in this [article](https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/full/10.1089/dia.2018.0278?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&rfr_id=ori%3Arid%3Acrossref.org&rfr_dat=cr_pub%3Dpubmed&), which could be used in loop (its no longer available, since pump was upgraded to x2), but that was not intended for commercial use, just for experimental use only (research projects). I talked with one of directors of company and he assured my that Tandem pump will never be open, but they have created their own closed loop system, which they are calling Control-IQ (I think it is already available in USA, and should be available in 2020 in Eu).

### Animas Vibe

**Loop status:** Not loopable. No remote control possibility. **Note:** Pump is not being sold anymore. Company stopped working in Pump bussiness (J&J).

* * *

### Animas Ping

**Loop status:** Not loopable. It has bolus possibility, but no TBR one. **Note** Stopped beeing sold when Vibe came out.

## Requirements for pumps being loopable

- Protocol is hacked/documented/etc.

**Minimal requirement**

- Set Temporary Basal Rate
- Get Status
- Cancel Temporary Basal Rate

**For oref1(SMB) or Bolusing:**

- Set Bolus

**Good to have**

- Get Basal Profile (almost requirement)
- Set Basal Profile (nice to have)
- Read History 

**Other (not required but good to have)**

- Set Extended Bolus
- Cancel Extended Bolus
- Read History

### Other pumps support

If you have any other pumps you would like to see status on, please contact me (@andyrozman on gitter). In future release a lot of Pump configurations will be added to be Open loopable (you will be able to select Virtual Pump Type in configuration and your settings will be loaded - [Feature request #863](https://github.com/MilosKozak/AndroidAPS/issues/863)).

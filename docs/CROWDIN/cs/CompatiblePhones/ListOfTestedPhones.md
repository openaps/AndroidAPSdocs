# List of tested Phones

Generic recommendations for choosing a phone suitable for **AAPS** can be found [here](../Getting-Started/Phones.md).

We currently don't have a generic list of tested phones working with **AAPS**. If you have questions regarding a specific phone model, please search or ask in our [Facebook or Discord community](../GettingHelp/WhereCanIGetHelp.md).

You may also refer to this outdated and **not maintained anymore** [list of compatible phones and watches](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gZAsN6f0gv6tkgy9EBsYl0BQNhna0RDqA9QGycAqCQc/edit?gid=698881435#gid=698881435).

Users of the [Omnipod Dash](../CompatiblePumps/OmnipodDASH.md) pump can go through the list of the [tested phones for Omnipod Dash](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zO-Vf3wv0jji5Gflk6pe48oi348ApF5RvMcI6NG5TnY). This list provides user feedback on the usage of a phone along with **AAPS** and Omnipod Dash pump. It can help you check if your phone and pump has been used successfully by other users.

The document is read-only. With CRTL-F, you can search in the text of the Google sheet.

To record your test of a phone, please fill in this [form](https://forms.gle/g7GbSkMCTfFrWKjSA). After you fill in the form data, the maintainer will check the data and approve it for publishing!

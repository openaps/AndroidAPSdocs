# Telefony

The current version of **AAPS** requires an Android smartphone with Google Android 9.0 or above. So if you are thinking about a new phone, Android 9 is recommended at a minimum but optimally choose Android 13 or 14.

For older Android versions, older **AAPS** versions are available see: [Release notes](#maintenance-android-version-aaps-version).

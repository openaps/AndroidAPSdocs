# Omnipod DASH

These instructions are for configuring the **Omnipod DASH** generation pump **(NOT Omnipod Eros)**. The Omnipod driver is available as part of AAPS (AAPS) as of version 3.0.

**This software is part of a DIY artificial pancreas solution and is not a product but requires YOU to read, learn, and understand the system, including how to use it. Jste jediní, kdo nese odpovědnost za to, co s tím uděláte.**

## Omnipod DASH specifications

These are the specifications of the **Omnipod DASH** and what differentiates it from the **Omnipod EROS**:

* The DASH pods are identified by a blue needle cap (EROS has a clear needle cap). The pods are otherwise identical in terms of physical dimensions
* No need for a separate Omnipod to BLE link/bridge device (NO RileyLink, OrangeLink, or EmaLink needed).
* BT connection only when needed, connects to send command and disconnects right after !
* No more "no connection to link device / pod" errors
* AAPS will wait for pod accessibility to send commands
* On activation, AAPS will find and connect a new DASH pod.
* Expected range: 5-10 meters (YMMV)

## Hardware/Software Requirements

* A new **Omnipod DASH Pod** (Identified by blue needle cap)

![Omnipod Pod](../images/DASH_images/Omnipod_Pod.png)

* **Compatible Android phone** with a BLE Bluetooth connection
   -  Not all phone hardware and Android versions are guaranteed to work. Please check [**DASH Tested phones**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zO-Vf3wv0jji5Gflk6pe48oi348ApF5RvMcI6NG5TnY) or just try with your phone and tell us the result (phone reference and geographical region, Android version, worked / some difficulties / did not work).
   - **Important note: There have been multiple cases of permanent, non-recoverable connection losses when using older pods with firmware version 3.XX.X. Be careful when using these old pods with AAPS, especially with other Bluetooth devices connected!** Be aware that AAPS Omnipod Dash driver Connects with the Dash POD via Bluetooth every time it sends a command, and it disconnects right after. The Bluetooth connections might be disturbed by other devices linked to the phone that is running AAPS, like earbuds etc... (which might cause, in rare occasions, connection issue or pod errors/loss on activation or afterwards in some phone models), or be disturbed by it.
   -  **Version 3.0 or newer of AAPS built and installed** using the [**Build APK**](../Installing-AndroidAPS/Building-APK.md) instructions.
* [**Continuous Glucose Monitor (CGM)**](https://androidaps.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Configuration/BG-Source.html)

These instructions will assume that you are starting a new pod session; if this is not the case, please be patient and begin this process on your following pod change.

## Než začnete

**SAFETY FIRST** - do not attempt this process in an environment where you cannot recover from an error (extra pods, insulin, and phone devices are must-haves).

**Your Omnipod Dash PDM will no longer work after the AAPS Dash driver activates your pod.** Previously you used your Dash PDM to send commands to your Dash pod. An Dash pod only allows a single device to send commands to communicate with it. Zařízení, které úspěšně aktivuje POD, je jediné, které může od tohoto okamžiku komunikovat s pumpou. This means that once you activate an Dash pod with your Android phone through the AAPS Dash driver, **you will no longer be able to use your PDM with that pod**. The AAPS Dash driver in your Android phone is now your acting PDM.

*This does NOT mean you should throw away your PDM, it is recommended to keep it around as a backup and for emergencies, for instance when your phone gets lost or AAPS is not working correctly.*

**Your pod will not stop delivering insulin when it is not connected to AAPS**. Default basal rates are programmed on the pod on activation as defined in the current active profile. As long as AAPS is operational it will send basal rate commands that run for a maximum of 120 minutes. When for some reason the pod does not receive any new commands (for instance because communication was lost due to Pod - phone distance) the pod will automatically fall back to default basal rates.

**30 min Basal Rate Profiles are NOT supported in AAPS.** **The AAPS Profile does not support a 30 minute basal rate time frame** If you are new to AAPS and are setting up your basal rate profile for the first time, please be aware that basal rates starting on a half-hour basis are not supported, and you will need to adjust your basal rate profile to start on the hour. For example, if you have a basal rate of 1.1 units which starts at 09:30 and has a duration of 2 hours ending at 11:30, this will not work. You will need to change this 1.1 unit basal rate to a time range of either 9:00-11:00 or 10:00-12:00. Even though the Omnipod Dash hardware itself supports the 30 min basal rate profile increments, AAPS is not able to take them into account with its algorithms currently.

**0U/h profile basal rates are NOT supported in AAPS** While the DASH pods do support a zero basal rate, since AAPS uses multiples of the profile basal rate to determine automated treatment it cannot function with a zero basal rate. A temporary zero basal rate can be achieved through the "Disconnect pump" function or through a combination of Disable Loop/Temp Basal Rate or Suspend Loop/Temp Basal Rate.

## Enabling the Dash Driver in AAPS

You can enable the Dash driver in AAPS in **two ways**:

### Option 1: New installations

When you are installing AAPS for the first time, the **Setup Wizard** will guide you through installing AAPS. Select “DASH” when you reach Pump selection.

![Enable_Dash_1](../images/DASH_images/Enable_Dash/Enable_Dash_1.png)

When in doubt you can also select “Virtual Pump” and select “DASH” later, after setting up AAPS (see option 2).

### Option 2: The Config Builder

On an existing installation you can select the **DASH** pump from the Config builder:

On the top-left hand corner **hamburger menu** select **Config Builder (1)**\ ➜\ **Pump**\ ➜\ **Dash**\ ➜\ **Settings Gear (3)** by selecting the **radio button (2)** titled **Dash**.

Selecting the **checkbox (4)** next to the **Settings Gear (3)** will allow the Dash menu to be displayed as a tab in the AAPS interface titled **DASH**. Checking this box will facilitate your access to the DASH commands when using AAPS.

**NOTE:** A faster way to access the [**Dash settings**](DanaRS-Insulin-Pump-dash-settings) can be found below in the Dash settings section of this document.

![Enable_Dash_3](../images/DASH_images/Enable_Dash/Enable_Dash_3.png)

### Verification of Omnipod Driver Selection

To verify that you have enabled the Dash driver in AAPS, if you have checked the box (4), **swipe to the left** from the **Overview** tab, where you will now see a **DASH** tab. If you have not checked the box, you’ll find the DASH tab in the hamburger menu upper left.

![Enable_Dash_4](../images/DASH_images/Enable_Dash/Enable_Dash_4.jpg)

## Dash Configuration

Please **swipe left** to the **DASH** tab where you will be able to manage all pod functions (some of these functions are not enabled or visible without an active pod session):

![Refresh_LOGO](../images/DASH_images/Refresh_LOGO.png) Refresh Pod connectivity and status, be able to silence pod alarms when the pod beeps

![POD_MGMT_LOGO](../images/DASH_images/POD_MGMT_LOGO.png) Pod Management (Activate, Deactivate, Play test beep, and Pod history)

(OmnipodDASH-activate-pod)=

### Aktivovat Pod

1. Navigate to the **DASH** tab and click on the **POD MGMT (1)** button, and then click on **Activate Pod (2)**.

![Activate_Pod_1](../images/DASH_images/Activate_Pod/Activate_Pod_1.png)    ![Activate_Pod_2](../images/DASH_images/Activate_Pod/Activate_Pod_2.png)

2. The **Fill Pod** screen is displayed. Naplňte nový POD nejméně 80 jednotkami inzulínu a poslouchejte, zda se ozvou dvě pípnutí, která značí, že POD je připraven k plnění. When calculating the total amount of insulin you need for 3 days, please take into account that priming the pod will use about 3-10 units.

![Activate_Pod_3](../images/DASH_images/Activate_Pod/Activate_Pod_3.png)    ![Activate_Pod_4](../images/DASH_images/Activate_Pod/Activate_Pod_4.jpg)

Ensure that the new pod and the phone running AAPS are within close proximity of each other and click the **Next** button.

**NOTE**: Just in case you get the below error message (this can happen), do not panic. Click on the **Retry** button. In most situations activation will continue successfully.

![Activate_Pod_3](../images/DASH_images/Activate_pod_error.png)

3. On the **Initialize Pod** screen, the pod will begin priming (you will hear a click followed by a series of ticking sounds as the pod primes itself).  A green checkmark will be shown upon successful priming, and the **Next** button will become enabled. Click on the **Next** button to complete the pod priming initialization and display the **Attach Pod** screen.

![Activate_Pod_5](../images/DASH_images/Activate_Pod/Activate_Pod_5.jpg)    ![Activate_Pod_6](../images/DASH_images/Activate_Pod/Activate_Pod_6.jpg)

4. Next, prepare the infusion site of the new pod. Remove the pod's plastic needle cap. If you see something that sticks out of the pod, cancel the process and start with a new pod. If everything looks OK, take off the white paper backing from the adhesive and apply the pod to the selected site on your body. When finished, click on the **Next** button.

![Activate_Pod_8](../images/DASH_images/Activate_Pod/Activate_Pod_8.jpg)

5. The **Attach Pod** dialog box will now appear. **click on the OK button ONLY if you are ready to deploy the cannula**.

![Activate_Pod_9](../images/DASH_images/Activate_Pod/Activate_Pod_9.jpg)

6. After pressing **OK**, it may take some time before the Dash pod responds and inserts the cannula (1-2 minutes maximum), so be patient.

 *NOTE: Before the cannula is inserted, it is good practice to pinch the skin near the cannula insertion point. This ensures a smooth insertion of the needle and will decrease your chances of developing occlusions.*

![Activate_Pod_10](../images/DASH_images/Activate_Pod/Activate_Pod_10.png)    ![Activate_Pod_11](../images/DASH_images/Activate_Pod/Activate_Pod_11.jpg)

7. A green checkmark appears, and the **Next** button becomes enabled upon successful cannula insertion. Click on the **Next** button.

![Activate_Pod_12](../images/DASH_images/Activate_Pod/Activate_Pod_12.jpg)

9. The **Pod activated** screen is displayed. Click on the green **Finished** button. Congratulations! You have now started a new active pod session.

![Activate_Pod_13](../images/DASH_images/Activate_Pod/Activate_Pod_13.jpg)

10. The **Pod management** menu screen should now display the **Activate Pod (1)** button *disabled* and the **Deactivate Pod (2)** button *enabled*. This is because a pod is now active and you cannot activate an additional pod without deactivating the currently active pod first.

    Click on the back button on your phone to return to the **DASH** tab screen which will now display Pod information for your active pod session, including current basal rate, pod reservoir level, insulin delivered, pod errors and alerts.

    For more details on the information displayed go to the [**DASH Tab**](OmnipodDASH-dash-tab) section of this document.

![Activate_Pod_14](../images/DASH_images/Activate_Pod/Activate_Pod_14.png)    ![Activate_Pod_15](../images/DASH_images/Activate_Pod/Activate_Pod_15.jpg)

It is good practice to export settings AFTER activating the pod. Do this at each pod change and once a month, copy the exported file to your internet drive. see [**Export settings Doc**](https://androidaps.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Usage/ExportImportSettings.html?highlight=exporting#export-import-settings).


(OmnipodDASH-deactivate-pod)=

### Deaktivovat Pod

Under normal circumstances, the expected lifetime of a pod is three days (72 hours) and an additional 8 hours after the pod expiration warning for a total of 80 hours of pod usage.

To deactivate a pod (either from expiration or from a pod failure):

1. Go to the **DASH** tab, click on the **POD MGMT (1)** button, on the **Pod management** screen click on the **Deactivate Pod (2)** button.

![Deactivate_Pod_1](../images/DASH_images/Deactivate_Pod/Deactivate_Pod_1.jpg)    ![Deactivate_Pod_2](../images/DASH_images/Deactivate_Pod/Deactivate_Pod_2.png)

2. On the **Deactivate Pod** screen, click on the **Next** button to begin the process of deactivating the pod. You will receive a confirmation beep from the pod that deactivation was successful.

![Deactivate_Pod_3](../images/DASH_images/Deactivate_Pod/Deactivate_Pod_3.jpg) ![Deactivate_Pod_4](../images/DASH_images/Deactivate_Pod/Deactivate_Pod_4.jpg)

3. A green checkmark will appear upon successful deactivation. Click on the **Next** button to display the pod deactivated screen. You may now remove your pod as the active session has been deactivated.

![Deactivate_Pod_5](../images/DASH_images/Deactivate_Pod/Deactivate_Pod_5.jpg)

4. Click on the green button to return to the **Pod Management** screen.

![Deactivate_Pod_6](../images/DASH_images/Deactivate_Pod/Deactivate_Pod_6.jpg)

5. You are now on the **Pod Management** menu; press the back button on your phone to return to the **DASH** tab. Verify that the **Pod status:** field displays a **No active Pod** message.

![Deactivate_Pod_7](../images/DASH_images/Deactivate_Pod/Deactivate_Pod_7.png) ![Deactivate_Pod_8](../images/DASH_images/Deactivate_Pod/Deactivate_Pod_8.jpg)

(OmnipodDASH-resuming-insulin-delivery)=

### Resuming Insulin Delivery

**Note**: During profile switches, dash must suspend delivery before setting the new basal profile. If communication fails between the two commands, then delivery can be suspended. Read [**Delivery suspended**](OmnipodDASH) in the troubleshooting section for more details.

Use this command to instruct the active, currently suspended pod to resume insulin delivery. After the command is successfully processed, insulin will resume normal delivery using the current basal rate based on the current time from the active basal profile. The pod will again accept commands for bolus, TBR, and SMB.

1. Go to the **DASH** tab and ensure the **Pod status (1)** field displays **SUSPENDED**, then press the **RESUME DELIVERY (2)** button to start the process to instruct the current pod to resume normal insulin delivery. A message **RESUME DELIVERY** will display in the **Pod Status (3)** field.

![Resume_1](../images/DASH_images/Resume/Resume_1.jpg)   ![Resume_2](../images/DASH_images/Resume/Resume_2.jpg)

2. When the Resume delivery command is successful, a confirmation dialog will display the message **Insulin delivery has been resumed**. Click **OK** to confirm and proceed.

![Resume_3](../images/DASH_images/Resume/Resume_3.png)

3. The **DASH** tab will update the **Pod status (1)** field to display **RUNNING,** and the **Resume Delivery** button will no longer be displayed

![Resume_4](../images/DASH_images/Resume/Resume_4.jpg)

### Silencing Pod Alerts

*NOTE - The SILENCE ALERTS button is only available on the **DASH** tab when the pod expiration or low reservoir alert has been triggered. If the SILENCE ALERTS button is not visible and you hear beep sounds from the pod, try to 'Refresh pod status'.*

The process below will show you how to acknowledge and dismiss pod beeps when the active pod time reaches the warning time limit before the pod expiration of 72 hours (3 days). This warning time limit is defined in the **Hours before shutdown** Dash alerts setting. The maximum life of a pod is 80 hours (3 days 8 hours), however Insulet recommends not exceeding the 72 hours (3 days) limit.

1. When the defined **Hours before shutdown** warning time limit is reached, the pod will issue warning beeps to inform you that it is approaching its expiration time and pod change will be required soon. You can verify this on the **DASH** tab, the **Pod expires: (1)** field will show the exact time the pod will expire (72 hours after activation), and the text will turn **red** after this time has passed. Under the **Active Pod alerts (2)** field the status message **Pod will expire soon** is displayed. This also will trigger displaying the **SILENCE ALERTS (3)** button.

![ACK_alerts_1](../images/DASH_images/ACK_Alerts/ACK_ALERTS_1.png)

2. Go to the **DASH** tab and press the **SILENCE ALERTS (2)** button . AAPS sends the command to the pod to deactivate the pod expiration warning beeps and updates the **Pod status (1)** field with **ACKNOWLEDGE ALERTS**.

![ACK_alerts_2](../images/DASH_images/ACK_Alerts/ACK_ALERTS_2.png)

3. Upon **successful deactivation** of the alerts, **2 beeps** will be issued by the active pod and a confirmation dialog will display the message **Activate alerts have been Silenced**. Click the **OK** button to confirm and dismiss the dialog.


![ACK_alerts_3](../images/DASH_images/ACK_Alerts/ACK_ALERTS_3.png)

4. Go to the **DASH** tab. Under the **Active Pod alerts** field, the warning message is no longer displayed, and the active pod will no longer issue pod expiration warning beeps.

(OmnipodDASH-view-pod-history)=

### View Pod History

This section shows you how to review your active pod history and filter by different action categories. The pod history tool allows you to view the actions and results committed to your currently active pod during its three days (72 - 80 hours) life.

This feature is helpful in verifying boluses, TBRs and basal commands that were sent to the pod. The remaining categories are useful for troubleshooting issues and determining the order of events that occurred leading up to a failure.

*NOTE:* **Only the last command can be uncertain**. New commands *will not be sent* until the **last 'uncertain' command becomes 'confirmed' or 'denied'**. The way to 'fix' uncertain commands is to **'refresh pod status'**.

1. Go to the **DASH** tab and press the **POD MGMT (1)** button to access the **Pod Management** menu and then press the **Pod history (2)** button to access the pod history screen.

![Pod_history_1](../images/DASH_images/Pod_History/Pod_history_1.jpg) ![Pod_history_2](../images/DASH_images/Pod_History/Pod_history_2.jpg)

2. On the **Pod history** screen, the default category of **All (1)** is displayed, showing the **Date and Time (2)** of all pod **Actions (3)** and **Results (4)** in reverse chronological order. Use your phone’s **back button 2 times** to return to the **DASH** tab in the main AAPS interface.

## Dash Settings

The Dash driver settings are configurable from the top-left hand corner **hamburger menu** under **Config Builder (1)**\ ➜\ **Pump**\ ➜\ **Dash**\ ➜\ **Settings Gear (3)** by selecting the **radio button (2)** titled **Dash**. Selecting the **checkbox (4)** next to the **Settings Gear (3)** will allow the Dash menu to be displayed as a tab in the AAPS interface titled **DASH**.

![Dash_settings_1](../images/DASH_images/Dash_settings/Dash_settings_1.png) ![Dash_settings_2](../images/DASH_images/Dash_settings/Dash_settings_2.png)

**NOTE:** A faster way to access the **Dash settings** is by accessing the **3 dot menu (1)** in the upper right hand corner of the **DASH** tab and selecting **Dash preferences (2)** from the dropdown menu.

![Dash_settings_3](../images/DASH_images/Dash_settings/Dash_settings_3.png)

The settings groups are listed below; you can enable or disable via a toggle switch for most entries described below:

![Dash_settings_4](../images/DASH_images/Dash_settings/Dash_settings_4.jpg)

*NOTE: An asterisk (\*) denotes the default setting is enabled.*

### Potvrzovací pípnutí

Provides confirmation beeps from the pod for bolus, basal, SMB, and TBR delivery and changes.

* **Bolus beeps enabled:** Enable or disable confirmation beeps when a bolus is delivered.
* **Basal beeps enabled:** Enable or disable confirmation beeps when a new basal rate is set, active basal rate is canceled or current basal rate is changed.
* **SMB beeps enabled:** Enable or disable confirmation beeps when a SMB is delivered.
* **TBR beeps enabled:** Enable or disable confirmation beeps when a TBR is set or canceled.

### Výstrahy

Provides AAPS alerts for pod expiration, shutdown, low reservoir based on the defined threshold units.

*Note an AAPS notification will ALWAYS be issued for any alert after the initial communication with the pod since the alert was triggered. Dismissing the notification will NOT dismiss the alert UNLESS automatically acknowledge Pod alerts is enabled. To MANUALLY dismiss the alert you must visit the **DASH** tab and press the **Silence ALERTS button**.*

* **Expiration reminder enabled:** Enable or disable the pod expiration reminder set to trigger when the defined number of hours before shutdown is reached.
* **Hours before shutdown:** Defines the number hours before the active pod shutdown occurs, which will then trigger the expiration reminder alert.
* **Low reservoir alert enabled:** Enable or disable an alert when the pod's remaining units low reservoir limit is reached as defined in the Number of units field.
* **Number of units:** The number of units at which to trigger the pod low reservoir alert.

### Oznámení

Provides AAPS notifications and audible phone alerts when it is uncertain if TBR, SMB, or bolus, and delivery suspended events were successful.

*NOTE: These are notifications only, no audible beep alerts are made.*

* **Sound for uncertain TBR notifications enabled:** Enable or disable this setting to trigger an audible alert and visual notification when AAPs is uncertain if a TBR was successfully set.
* **Sound for uncertain SMB notifications enabled:** Enable or disable this setting to trigger an audible alert and visual notification when AAPS is uncertain if an SMB was successfully delivered.
* **Sound for uncertain bolus notifications enabled:** Enable or disable this setting to trigger an audible alert and visual notification when AAPS is uncertain if a bolus was successfully delivered.
* **Sound when delivery suspended notifications enabled:** Enable or disable this setting to trigger an audible alert and visual notification when suspend delivery was successfully delivered.

## Actions (ACT) Tab

This tab is well documented in the main AAPS documentation but there are a few items on this tab that are specific to how the Omnipod Dash pod differs from tube based pumps, especially after the processes of applying a new pod.

1. Go to the **Actions (ACT)** tab in the main AAPS interface.

2. Under the **Careportal (1)** section the **Insulin** and **Cannula** filds will have their **age reset** to 0 days and 0 hours **after each pod change**. This is done because of how the Omnipod pump is built and operates. Since the pod inserts the cannula directly into the skin at the site of the pod application, a traditional tube is not used in Omnipod pumps. *Therefore after a pod change the age of each of these values will automatically reset to zero.* **Pump battery age** is not reported as the battery in the pod will always be more than the life of the pod (maximum 80 hours). The **pump battery** and **insulin reservoir** are self contained inside of each pod.

![ACT_1](../images/DASH_images/Actions_Tab/ACT_1.png)

### Úroveň

**Insulin Level**

Insulin level displayed is the amount reported by Omnipod DASH. However, the pod only reports the actual insulin reservoir level when it is below 50 units. Until then “Above 50 units” will be displayed. The amount reported is not exact: when the pod reports ‘empty’ in most cases the reservoir will still have some additional units of insulin left. The omnipod DASH overview tab will display as described the below:

  * **Above 50 Units** - The Pod reports more than 50 units currently in the reservoir.
  * **Below 50 Units** - The amount of insulin remaining in the reservoir as reported by the Pod.

Additional note:
  * **SMS** - Returns value or 50+U for SMS responses
  * **Nightscout** - Uploads value of 50 when over 50 units to Nightscout (version 14.07 and older).  Newer versions will report a value of 50+ when over 50 units.

## Řešení problémů

(OmnipodDASH-delivery-suspended)=

### Delivery suspended

  * There is no suspend button anymore. If you want to "suspend" the pod, you can set a zero TBR for x minutes.
  * During profile switches, dash must suspend delivery before setting the new basal profile. If communication fails between the two commands, then delivery can stay suspended. When this happens:
     - There will be no insulin delivery, that includes Basal, SMB, Manual bolusing etc.
     - There might be notification that one of the commands is unconfirmed: this depends on when the failure happened.
     - AAPS will try to set the new basal profile every 15 minutes.
     - AAPS will show a notification informing that the delivery is suspended every 15min, if the delivery is still suspended (resume delivery failed).
     - The [**Resume delivery**](OmnipodDASH-resuming-insulin-delivery) button will be active if the user chooses to resume delivery manually.
     - If AAPS fail to resume delivery on its own (this happens if the Pod is unreachable, sound is muted, etc), the pod will start beeping 4 time every minute for 3 minutes, then repeated every 15 minutes if delivery is still suspended for more than 20minutes.
  * For unconfirmed commands, "refresh pod status" should confirm/deny them.

**Note:** When you hear beeps from the pod, do not assume that delivery will continue without checking the phone, delivery might stay suspended, **so you need to check !**

### Pod Failures

Pods fail occasionally due to a variety of issues, including hardware issues with the Pod itself. It is best practice not to call these into Insulet, since AAPS is not an approved use case. A list of fault codes can be [**found here**](https://github.com/openaps/openomni/wiki/Fault-event-codes) to help determine the cause.

### Preventing error 49 pod failures

This failure is related to an incorrect pod state for a command or an error during an insulin delivery command. This is when the driver and Pod disagree on the actual state. The Pod (out of a build-in safety measure) then reacts with an unrecoverable error code 49 (0x31) ending up with what is know as a “screamer”: the long irritating beep that can only be stopped by punching a hole at the appropriate location at the back of the Pod. The exact origin of a “49 pod failure” often is hard to trace. In situations that are suspected for this failure to occur (for instance on application crashes, running a development version or re-installation).

### Pump Unreachable Alerts

When no communication can be established with the pod for a preconfigured time a “Pump unreachable” alert will be raised. Pump unreachable alerts can be configured by going to the top right-hand side three-dot menu, selecting **Preferences**\ ➜\ **Local Alerts**\ ➜\ **Pump unreachable threshold [min]**. Recommended value is alerting after **120** minutes.

### Export  Settings

Exporting AAPS settings enables you to restore all your settings, and maybe more importantly, all your Objectives. You may need to restore settings to the “last known working situation” or after uninstalling/reinstalling AAPS or in case of phone loss, reinstalling on the new phone.

Note: The active pod information is included in the exported settings. If you import an "old" exported file, your actual pod will "die". There is no other alternative. In some cases (like a _programmed_ phone change), you may need to use the exported file to restore AndroisAPS settings **while keeping the current active Pod**. In this case it is important to only use the recently exported settings file containing the pod currently active.

**It is good practice to do an export immediately after activating a pod**. This way you will always be able to restore the current active Pod in case of a problem. For instance when moving to another backup phone.

Regularly copy your exported settings to a safe place (as a cloud drive) that can be accessible by any phone when needed (e.g. in case of a phone loss or factory reset of the actual phone).

### Import Settings

**WARNING** Please note that importing settings will possibly import an outdated Pod status. As a result, there is a risk of losing the active Pod! (see **Exporting Settings**). It is better to only try it when no other options are available.

When importing settings with an active Pod, make sure the export was done with the currently active pod.

**Importing while on an active Pod:** (you risk losing the Pod!)

1. Make sure you are importing settings that were recently exported with the currently active Pod.
2. Import your settings
3. Check all preferences

**Importing (no active Pod session)**

1. Importing any recent export should work (see above)
2. Import your settings.
3. Check all preferences.
4. You may need to **Deactivate** the "non exixting" pod if the imported settings included any active pod data.

### Importing settings that contain Pod state from an inactive Pod

When importing settings containing data for a Pod that is no longer active, AAPS will try to connect with it, which will obviously fail. You can not activate a new Pod in this situation.

To remove the old Pod session “try” to de-activate the Pod. The de-activation will fail. Select “Retry”. After the second or third retry you will get the option to remove the pod. Once the old pod is removed you will be able to activate a new Pod.

### Reinstalling AAPS

When uninstalling AAPS you will lose all your settings, objectives and the current Pod session. To restore them make sure you have a recent exported settings file available!

When on an active Pod, make also sure that you have an export for the current Pod session or you will lose the currently active Pod when importing older settings.

1. Export your settings and store a copy in a safe place.
2. Uninstall AAPS and restart your phone.
3. Install the new version of AAPS.
4. Import your settings
5. Verify all preferences (optionally import settings again)
6. Activate a new Pod
7. When done: Export current settings

### Updating AAPS to a newer version

In most cases there is no need to uninstall. You can do an “in-place” install by starting the installation for the new version. This is also possible when on an active Pod  session.

1. Export your settings.
2. Install  the new AAPS version.
3. Verify the installation was successful
4. RESUME the Pod or activate a new Pod.
5. When done: Export current settings.

### Omnipod driver alerts

A summary of the main alerts that you may encounter is listed below:

* No active Pod No active Pod session detected. This alert can temporarily be dismissed by pressing **SNOOZE** but it will keep triggering as long as a new pod has not been activated. Once activated this alert is automatically be silenced.

* The current log is a .log file which can be viewed in a number of ways such as [LogCat](https://developer.android.com/studio/debug/am-logcat.html) within Android Studio, any Log Viewer android app, or simply as plain text. 
* Previous log files are zipped and stored in folders in date/time order. 
* If you are sharing your log file in [discord](https://discord.gg/4fQUWHZ4Mw) to talk about a potential bug, please unzip and upload the file dated before the error occurred.

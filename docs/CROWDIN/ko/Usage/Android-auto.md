How to use it:

* Install Android Auto
* In the Android Auto app, tap the Hamburger menu (three horizontal lines)
* Tap About.
* Tap the About Android Auto header 10 times, until a toast appears that says "Developer mode enabled".
* Now you can access developer mode by selecting the overflow menu dots on the top right of the handheld screen and go into developpers settings.
* Select unknown sources (scroll down all the way to the bottom of the list).
* Now you can quit developper mode if you want. Tap three dots menu on the top right to do so.

Troubleshooting:

* If you don't see the notification, check if you allowed AAPS to show notifications in Android and if Android Auto has access rights to notifications.

    ### Translating links
    
    ```{admonition} Links are not translated anymore
    :class: note
    
    Links are not translated anymore. In the past we had a topic here but this is gone as through migraton to Markdown and the myst_parser we explicitly create labels in the english text and propagate these labels under the hood to the languages.
    
    

You are translating the text which represents the link. Please you have to be carefull **not** to remove the link which is represented by a pair of `<0></0>` tags or if their are more in one paragraph other numbers.

It's the proofreaders job to have a special look on this!

### Proofreading

* Proofreaders have to switch to Proofreading mode
    
    ![Proofreading mode docs](./images/translation_WikiProofreadingmode.png)
    
    and approve translated texts
    
    ![approve text](./images/translations-proofreading.png)

* When a proofreader approves a translation it will be added to the next docs build which happens in no fixed schedule on demand but around once a week except during hollidays. To speed up the process you can inform docs team about new translations.

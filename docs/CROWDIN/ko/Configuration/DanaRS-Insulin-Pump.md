## Dana RS specific errors

### Error during insulin delivery

In case the connection between AAPS and Dana RS is lost during bolus insulin delivery (i.e. you walk away from phone while Dana RS is pumping insulin) you will see the following message and hear an alarm sound.

![Alarm insulin delivery](../images/DanaRS_Error_bolus.png)

* In most cases this is just a communication issue and the correct amount of insulin is delivered.
* Check in pump history (either on the pump or through Dana tab > pump history > boluses) if correct bolus is given.
* Delete error entry in [treatments tab](Screenshots-carb-correction) if you wish.
* Real amount is read and recorded on next connect. To force this press BT icon on dana tab or just wait for next connect.

## Special note when switching phone

When switching to a new phone the following steps are necessary:

* [Export settings](ExportImportSettings-export-settings) on your old phone
* Transfer settings from old to new phone

### DanaRS v1

* **Manually pair** Dana RS with the new phone
* As pump connection settings are also imported AAPS on your new phone will already "know" the pump and therefore not start a bluetooth scan. Therefore new phone and pump must be paired manually.
* Install AndroidAPS on the new phone.
* [Import settings](ExportImportSettings-import-settings) on your new phone

### DanaRS v3, Dana-i

* Start pairing procedure like decribed [above](DanaRS-Insulin-Pump-pairing-pump).
* Sometimes it may be necessary to clear pairing information in AndroidAPS by long-click BT icon on Dana-i/RS tab.

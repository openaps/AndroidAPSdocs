# xDrip+ settings

If not already set up then download [xDrip+](https://github.com/NightscoutFoundation/xDrip)

For G6 transmitters manufactured after fall/end of 2018 (i.e. serial no. starting with 80 or 81) please make sure to use at least the [master dated 2019/05/18](https://jamorham.github.io/#xdrip-plus).

If your Dexcom G6 transmitter's serial no. is starting with 8G... try [nightly build 2019/07/28 or later](https://github.com/NightscoutFoundation/xDrip/releases).

## Basic settings for all CGM & FGM systems

* Make sure to set Base URL correctly including **S** at the end of http**s**:// (not http://)
   
   i.e. https://API_SECRET@your-app-name.herokuapp.com/api/v1/
   
   -> Hamburger Menu (top left of homescreen) -> Settings-> Cloud Upload-> Nightscout Sync (REST-API) -> Base URL

* Deactivate `Automatic Calibration` If the checkbox for `Automatic Calibration` is checked, activate `Download data` once, then remove the checkbox for `Automatic Calibration` and deactivate `Download data` again, otherwise the treatments (insulin & carbs) will be added twice to Nightscout.

* Tap `Extra Options`
* Deactivate `Upload treatments` and `Back-fill data`
* Option `Alert on failures` should also be deactivated. Otherwise you will get an alarm every 5 minutes in case wifi/mobile network is too bad or the server is not available.

   ![xDrip+ Basic Settings 2](../images/xDrip_Basic2.png)

* **InterApp-Settings** (Broadcast) If you are going to use AndroidAPS and the data should be forwarded to i.e. AndroidAPS you have to activate broadcasting in xDrip+ in Inter-App settings.

* In order for the values to be equal, you should activate `Send the displayed glucose value`.
* If you have also activated `Accept treatments` and broadcasting in AndroidAPS, then xDrip+ will receive insulin, carbs and basal rate information from AndroidAPS and can estimate the hypo prediction etc. more accurately.
   
   ![xDrip+ Basic Settings 3](../images/xDrip_Basic3.png)

* Some people have discovered problems with local broadcast (AAPS not receiving BG values from xDrip+) when phone is in airplane mode. Go to Settings > Inter-app settings > Identify receiver and enter `info.nightscout.androidaps`.

## xDrip+ & Dexcom G6

### xDrip+ version depending on G6 transmitter serial no.

For G6 transmitters manufactured after fall/end of 2018 (i.e. serial no. starting with 80 or 81) please make sure to use at least the [master dated 2019/05/18](https://jamorham.github.io/#xdrip-plus).

If your Dexcom G6 transmitter's serial no. is starting with 8G... try [nightly build 2019/07/28 or later](https://github.com/NightscoutFoundation/xDrip/releases).

### Dexcom specific settings

* Open G5/G6 Debug Settings -> Hamburger Menu (top left of homescreen) -> Settings -> G5/G6 Debug Settings ![Open xDrip+ Settings](../images/xDrip_Dexcom_SettingsCall.png)

* Enable the following settings
   
   * `Use the OB1 Collector`
   * `Native Algorithm` (important if you want to use SMB)
   * `G6 support`
   * `Allow OB1 unbonding`
   * `Allow OB1 initiate bonding`
* All other options should be disabled
* Adjust battery warning level to 280 (bottom of G5/G6 Debug Settings)
   
   ![xDrip+ G5/G6 Debug Settings](../images/xDrip_Dexcom_DebugSettings.png)

### Preemptive restarts not recommended

The automatic extension of Dexcom sensors (`preemtive restarts`) is not recommended as this might lead to “jumps” in BG values on day 9 after restart.

![xDrip+ Jump after Preemptive Restart](../images/xDrip_Dexcom_PreemptiveJump.png)

Dexcom G6를 사용하는 것은 맨 처음 육안으로 보여지는 것 보다 좀더 복잡합니다. 그것을 안전하게 사용하기 위해서는 , 몇가지 인지하고 넘어갈 것들이 있습니다.

* If you are using the native data with the calibration code in xDrip+ or Spike, the safest thing to do is not allow preemptive restarts of the sensor.
* 만일 당신이 불가피하게 preemptive restarts 옵션을 사용하여야한다면, 어느장소에서 혈당값 변화를 인지하며, 필요한 경우 이를 보정할 수 있는지 하루 중에 따로따로 기입하세요. 
* 만일 당신이 센서를 재시작할 예정이라면, 11일 그리고 12일동안에 해당하는 가장 안전한 결과값을 위하여, 공장보정 없이 어느방법으로도 재시작을 할수 있습니다. 그렇지않다면 변화값을 주시하고 보정을 하셔야 합니다.
* 공장보정을 한 Dexcom G6의 Pre-soaking은 결과적으로 혈당값의 편차를 제공할 수 있습니다. 만일 당신이 Pre-soak을 한다면, 가장 정확한 결과값을 얻기위해 센서보정을 할 필요가 있습니다.
* 혈당값의 변화를 보는 것이 불가하다면, 공장보정이 되지않은 방식으로 바꾸고, Dexcom G5와 같은 시스템을 사용하는 것이 바람직합니다.

To learn more about the details and reasons for these recommendations read the [complete article](http://www.diabettech.com/artificial-pancreas/diy-looping-and-cgm/) published by Tim Street at [www.diabettech.com](http://www.diabettech.com).

### Connect G6 transmitter for the first time

**For second and following transmitters see [Extend transmitter life](../Configuration/xdrip#extend-transmitter-life) below.**

For G6 transmitters manufactured after fall/end of 2018 (i.e. serial no. starting with 80 or 81) please make sure to use at least the [master dated 2019/05/18](https://jamorham.github.io/#xdrip-plus).

If your Dexcom G6 transmitter's serial no. is starting with 8G... try [nightly build 2019/07/28 or later](https://github.com/NightscoutFoundation/xDrip/releases).

* Turn original Dexcom receiver off (if used).
* Long press the red xDrip+ blood drop icon on the main screen to enable the `Source Wizard Button`.
* Use the Source Wizard Button which ensures default settings including OB1 & Native Mode 
   * This guides you through the initial set up.
   * you will need your transmitter serial number if this is the first time you've used it.

* Put in serial number of new transmitter (on the transmitter packaging or on the back of the transmitter). Be careful not to confuse 0 (zero) and O (capital letter o).
   
   ![xDrip+ Dexcom Transmitter Serial No](../images/xDrip_Dexcom_TransmitterSN.png)

* Insert new sensor (only if replacing)

* Put transmitter into sensor
* **Wait 15 minutes** before starting sensor so xDrip can initialize communication with the new transmitter
* Start sensor (only if replacing)
   
   -> Near the bottom of the screen `Warm Up x,x hours left` must be displayed after a few minutes.

-> If your transmitter serial no. does not start with 8G and there is no time specification after a few minutes stop and restart the sensor.

* Restart collector (system status - if not replacing sensor}
* Do not turn original Dexcom receiver (if used) back on before xDrip+ shows first readings.
* Long press the red xDrip+ blood drop icon on the main screen to disable the `Source Wizard Button`.

   ![xDrip+ Dexcom Transmitter 3](../images/xDrip_Dexcom_Transmitter03.png)
   
   ![xDrip+ Dexcom Transmitter 4](../images/xDrip_Dexcom_Transmitter04.png)

### Transmitter battery status

* Battery status can be controlled in system status (Hamburger menu top left on homescreen)
* Swipe left once to see second screen. ![xDrip+ First Transmitter 4](../images/xDrip_Dexcom_Battery.png)

* The exact values when the transmitter “dies” due to empty battery are not known. The following information was posted online after the transmitter “died”: Transmitter days: 151 Voltage A: 297 Voltage B: 260 Resistance: 2391

### Extend transmitter life

* Running sensor session will be stopped when extending transmitter life. So extend before sensor change or be aware that there will be a new 2 h warm-up phase.
* Switch to the `engineering mode`: 
   * tap on the character on the right of the xDrip+ start screen that represents a syringe
   * then tap on the microphone icon in the lower right corner
   * In the text box that opens type "enable engineering mode" 
   * click "Done"
   * If Google Speak engine is enabled, you can also speak the voice command: "enable engineering mode". 
* Go to the G5 debug settings and check `OB1 collector`.
* Use the voice command: “hard reset transmitter”
* The voice command will be executed with the next data receipt of the transmitter
* Look at the system status (Hamburger menu -> system status) and see what happens
* If you see a message "Phone Service State: Hard Reset maybe failed" on second system status screen just start the sensor and this message should go away.
   
   ![xDrip+ Hard Reset maybe failed](../images/xDrip_HardResetMaybeFailed.png)

* Transmitter days will be set to 0 after successful extension and start of sensor.

### Replace transmitter

For G6 transmitters manufactured after fall/end of 2018 (i.e. serial no. starting with 80 or 81) please make sure to use at least the [master dated 2019/05/18](https://jamorham.github.io/#xdrip-plus).

If your Dexcom G6 transmitter's serial no. is starting with 8G... try [nightly build 2019/07/28 or later](https://github.com/NightscoutFoundation/xDrip/releases).

* Turn original Dexcom receiver off (if used).
* Stop sensor (only if replacing sensor)
   
   Ensure it really is stopped:
   
   On the second "G5/G6 Status" screen look at `Queue Items` about half way down - It may say something like `(1) Stop Sensor`
   
   Wait until this goes - usually within a few minutes.
   
   -> To remove transmitter without stopping sensor see this video <https://youtu.be/AAhBVsc6NZo>.
   
   ![xDrip+ Stop Dexcom Sensor 1](../images/xDrip_Dexcom_StopSensor.png)
   
   ![xDrip+ Stop Dexcom Sensor 2](../images/xDrip_Dexcom_StopSensor2.png)

* Forget device (in system status)
   
   ![xDrip+ Forget Device](../images/xDrip_Dexcom_ForgetDevice.png)

* Forget device in smartphone’s BT settings (Will be shown as DexcomXX whereas XX are the last two digits of the transmitter serial no.)

* Remove transmitter (and sensor if replacing sensor)
* Long press the red xDrip+ blood drop icon on the main screen to enable the `Source Wizard Button`.
* Use the Source Wizard Button which ensures default settings including OB1 & Native Mode 
   * This guides you through the initial set up.
   * You will need your transmitter serial number if this is the first time you've used it.
* Put in serial number of new transmitter.
* Insert new sensor (only if replacing).
* Put transmitter into sensor
* Start sensor (only if replacing)
   
   **It is recommended to wait approx. 15 minutes between stopping and starting the new sensor (until `Sensor Status: Stopped` is shown on second system status screen).**

* Restart collector (system status - if not replacing sensor}

* Do not turn original Dexcom receiver (if used) back on before xDrip+ shows first readings.
* Long press the red xDrip+ blood drop icon on the main screen to disable the `Source Wizard Button`.
   
   ![xDrip+ Dexcom Transmitter 1](../images/xDrip_Dexcom_Transmitter01.png)

   ![xDrip+ Dexcom Transmitter 3](../images/xDrip_Dexcom_Transmitter03.png)
   
   ![xDrip+ Dexcom Transmitter 4](../images/xDrip_Dexcom_Transmitter04.png)

### New Sensor

* Turn original Dexcom receiver off (if used).
* Stop sensor if necessary
   
   Ensure it really is stopped:
   
   On the second "G5/G6 Status" screen look at `Queue Items` about half way down - It may say something like `(1) Stop Sensor`
   
   Wait until this goes - usually within a few minutes.
   
   ![xDrip+ Stop Dexcom Sensor 1](../images/xDrip_Dexcom_StopSensor.png)
   
   ![xDrip+ Stop Dexcom Sensor 2](../images/xDrip_Dexcom_StopSensor2.png)

* Clean contacts (transmitter backside) with alcohol and let air-dry.

* In case you use this function disable `Restart Sensor` and `Preemptive restarts` (Hamburger menu -> Settings -> G5/G6 Debug Settings). If you miss this step and have these functions enabled the new sensor will not start properly.
   
   ![xDrip+ Preemptive Restart](../images/xDrip_Dexcom_Restart.png)

* Start Sensor
   
   **It is recommended to wait approx. 15 minutes between stopping and starting the new sensor (until `Sensor Status: Stopped` is shown on second system status screen).**

* Set time inserted
   
   * To use G6 Native mode you must wait for the 2 hour warm up (i.e insertion time is now).
   * If you are using the xDrip+ algorithm then you can set a time more than 2 hours ago to avoid warm up. Readings may be very erratic. Therefore this is not recommended.
* Enter Sensor code (on the peel-off foil of the sensor) 
   * Keep code for further reference (i.e. new start after transmitter had to be removed)
   * Code can also be found in [xDrip+ logs](../Configuration/xdrip#retrieve-sensor-code): Click 3-dots-menu on xDrip+ homescreen and choose `View Event Logs`.
* No calibration is needed if you use G6 in "native mode". xDrip+ will show readings automatically after 2 hour warm-up.
* Do not turn original Dexcom Receiver (if used) back on before xDrip+ shows first readings.

   ![xDrip+ Start Dexcom Sensor 2](../images/xDrip_Dexcom_SensorStart02.png)

### Retrieve sensor code

* In latest nightly builds the sensor code is shown in system status (Hamburger menu top left on homescreen).
* Swipe left once to see second screen.
   
   ![xDrip+ Retrieve Dexcom Sensor Code2](../images/xDrip_Dexcom_SensorCode2.png)

* Dexcom sensor code can also be found in xDrip+ logs.

* Tap 3 dot menu (top right side on homescreen)
* Select `View Event Logs` and search for "code"
   
   ![xDrip+ Retrieve Dexcom Sensor Code](../images/xDrip_Dexcom_SensorCode.png)

## Troubleshooting Dexcom G6 and xDrip+

### Problem connecting transmitter

* Transmitter must be shown in your smartphone's bluetooth settings.
* Transmitter will be shown as Dexcom?? whereas ?? represent the last two digits of your transmitter serial no. (i.e. DexcomHY).
* Open system status in xDrip+ (hamburger menue on top left side of home screen).
* Check if your transmitter is shown on first status page ('classic status page').
* If not: Delete device from your smartphone's bluetooth settings.
* Wait about 5 min. until Dexcom transmitter reconnects automatically.

### Problem when starting new sensor

* Native sensor is marked as "FAILED: Sensor Failed Start"
* Stop sensor
* Restart your phone
* Start sensor with code 0000 (four times zero)
* Wait 15 minutes
* Stop sensor
* Start sensor with "real" code (printed on the adhesive protector)

Check in xDrip+ logs if xDrip+ starts counting "Duration: 1 minute" (and so on). Only in the xdrip+ logs you can detect at an early stage whether xdrip+ has stopped a sensor. Latest status is not always shown correctly on bottom of startscreen.

## xDrip+ & Freestyle Libre

### Libre specific settings

* Open Bluetooth Settings -> Hamburger Menu (top left of homescreen) -> Settings -> scroll down -> Less common settings -> Bluetooth Settings
   
   ![xDrip+ Libre Bluetooth Settings 1](../images/xDrip_Libre_BTSettings1.png)

* Enable the following settings
   
   * `Turn Bluetooth on` 
   * `Use scanning`
   * `Always discover services`

* All other options should be disabled

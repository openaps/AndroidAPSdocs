# Dexcom G6 e ONE

## Prima le basi

-   Follow general CGM hygiene and setting sensor recommendation [here](../CompatibleCgms/GeneralCGMRecommendation.md).

## General hints for looping with G6 and ONE

- Recent transmitters are called Firefly. Sensors cannot be restarted without removing the transmitter, which itself cannot be reset, they also do not generate raw data.

- If you are restarting sensors, ensure you are ready to calibrate and keep an eye on variation.

- Pre-soaking of the G6/ONE with factory calibration is likely to give variation in results. If you do pre-soak, then to get best results, you will probably need to calibrate the sensor.

## Se usi G6 o ONE con xDrip

- If not already set up, download [xDrip](https://github.com/NightscoutFoundation/xDrip) and adjust its settings following the [xDrip settings page](../CompatibleCgms/xDrip.md).
- Seleziona xDrip in [**Configurazione → Sorgente Glicemia**](#Config-Builder-bg-source).
- The Dexcom G6 and ONE transmitters can simultaneously be connected to the Dexcom receiver (or alternatively the t:slim pump) and one app on your phone.
- Se usi xDrip come ricevitore, disinstalla prima l'app Dexcom. **Non puoi collegare xDrip e l'app Dexcom al trasmettitore nello stesso momento!**
- If you need Clarity and want to profit from xDrip alarms use the [BYODA](#DexcomG6-if-using-g6-with-build-your-own-dexcom-app) (only G6) with local broadcast to xDrip.
- You can also use xDrip as a companion app of the official Dexcom app, but you might experience delays in BG readings. To read the Dexcom app notifications without xDrip, as a trusted data source, use the [Notification Reader](#DexcomG6-notification-reader).
- xDrip always uses the transmitter's [native algorithm](https://navid200.github.io/xDrip/docs/Native-Algorithm.html) with current transmitters; there is no reason to disable it. [Preemptive restarts](https://navid200.github.io/xDrip/docs/Preemptive-Restart.html) only function on old transmitters (firmware 1.6.5.25 or earlier), where they are needed to prevent the sensor stopping after 10 days; recent (Firefly) transmitters ignore them. See [Restart a sensor](https://navid200.github.io/xDrip/docs/Restart-G6-sensor.html) before attempting any restart.
- Everything related to the sensor and transmitter themselves is documented on the [xDrip Dexcom page](https://navid200.github.io/xDrip/docs/Dexcom_page.html).

## Se usi il G6 con Build Your Own Dexcom App

```{admonition} Old app version
:class: warning
Dexcom BYODA is now a very old version of the app and cannot be updated.
```

-   [Build Your Own Dexcom App](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScD76G0Y-BlL4tZljaFkjlwuqhT83QlFM5v6ZEfO7gCU98iJQ/viewform?fbzx=2196386787609383750) (BYODA) supports local broadcast to AAPS and/or xDrip

-   Questa app ti permette di usare il tuo Dexcom G6 con qualsiasi smartphone Android.
-   Uninstall the original Dexcom app or patched Dexcom app if you used one of those previously (**do not stop** the currently running sensor)
-   Installa l'apk scaricato
-   Inserisci il codice del sensore e il numero di serie del trasmettitore nell'app modificata.
-   Nelle impostazioni del telefono vai su app > Dexcom G6 > autorizzazioni > autorizzazioni aggiuntive e premi 'Access Dexcom app'.
-   Dopo poco tempo BYODA dovrebbe ricevere il segnale del trasmettitore.

### Impostazioni per AAPS

-   Seleziona **BYODA** in [**Configurazione → Sorgente Glicemia**](#Config-Builder-bg-source).

-   If you don't receive any values select any other data source, then re-select **BYODA** to trigger the demand for permissions to establish the connection between AAPS and BYODA-broadcast.

### Impostazioni per xDrip

-   Select '640G/Eversense' as data source.
-   Command 'start sensor' must be performed in xDrip in order to receive values. This will not affect your current sensor controlled by Build Your Own Dexcom App.

(DexcomG6-notification-reader)=
## If using G6 or ONE with the Notification Reader

The official Dexcom G6 or ONE app stays connected to the transmitter. **AAPS** reads the glucose value directly from the notification of the Dexcom app, without any other app in between.

```{admonition} Trusted data source
:class: note
Readings from the Dexcom G6 and ONE apps are a [trusted BG data source](#GettingStarted-TrustedBGSource): SMBs can be allowed all the time.
```

Compared to BYODA or xDrip, the Notification Reader has limits:

- **No trend arrow** and **no backfill**: readings missed while the phone was off or out of range are lost.
- Each reading gets the time the notification appeared, not the exact time of the sensor reading.
- Only values between 40 and 405 mg/dL (2.2 and 22.5 mmol/L) are read. "LOW" and "HIGH" are not read.

### Set up the Dexcom app

-   Keep the Dexcom app installed and connected to the transmitter.
-   Make sure the Dexcom app shows the current glucose value in its notification. Le sue notifiche devono restare visibili: non silenziarle e non nasconderle.
-   Use the same glucose units (mg/dL or mmol/L) in the Dexcom app as in **AAPS**. Otherwise **AAPS** cannot read the value.

### Configurazione in AAPS

-   Select **Notification Reader** in [**Configuration → BG Source**](#Config-Builder-bg-source) and confirm the switch.

    ![BG Source: Notification Reader selected](../images/NotificationReader_BgSource.png)

-   Back on the main screen, **AAPS** shows **Permissions Required**. Next to **Notification Access**, tap **Grant**.

    ![Permissions Required: Notification Access](../images/NotificationReader_Permissions.png)

-   Android opens its notification access list (its name depends on your Android version, for example *Notification read, reply & control*). Select **AAPS**, turn on **Allow notification access** and confirm with **Allow**.

    ![Android asks to allow notification access for AAPS](../images/NotificationReader_AllowDialog.png)

    Android warns that **AAPS** could read all your notifications. **AAPS** only reads the notifications of supported CGM apps and ignores all others.

    ![Notification access allowed for AAPS](../images/NotificationReader_AccessOn.png)

-   If **Allow notification access** is greyed out (*Controlled by Restricted Setting*), Android blocks it because **AAPS** was not installed from the Play Store. Open the **AAPS** app info (long press the **AAPS** icon > **App info**), tap the three dots menu at the top right and select **Allow restricted settings**. Poi torna alla schermata dell'accesso alle notifiche e consentilo.
-   Readings appear in **AAPS** when the Dexcom app shows a new value.

```{warning}
If the Dexcom app notification shows more than one glucose number, or none, **AAPS** skips that notification.
```

## Troubleshooting G6 and ONE

### Dexcom G6/ONE specific troubleshooting

-   Scroll down to **Troubleshooting** [here](https://navid200.github.io/xDrip/docs/Dexcom_page.html).

### General troubleshooting

General Troubleshooting for CGMs can be found [here](#general-cgm-troubleshooting).

### New transmitter with running sensor

If you happen to change transmitter during a running sensor session you might try to remove the transmitter without damaging the sensor mount. A video can be found [here](https://navid200.github.io/xDrip/docs/Remove-transmitter.html). If you opt for [this solution](https://youtu.be/tx-kTsrkNUM) instead, you must be careful to avoid [damaging sensor contacts](https://navid200.github.io/xDrip/docs/Petroleum-jelly-in-Dexcom-G6-Sensor.html) with the strip.

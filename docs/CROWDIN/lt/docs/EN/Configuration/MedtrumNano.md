## Before you begin

**SAFETY FIRST** Do not attempt this process in an environment where you cannot recover from an error (extra patches, insulin, and pump control devices are must-haves).

**The PDM and Medtrum App will not work with a patch that is activated by AAPS.** Previously you may have used your PDM or Medtrum app to send commands to your pump. For security reasons you can only use the activated patch with the device or app that was used to activate it.

*This does NOT mean that you should throw away your PDM. It is recommended to keep it somewhere safe as a backup in case of emergencies, for instance if your phone gets lost or AAPS is not working correctly.*

**Your pump will not stop delivering insulin when it is not connected to AAPS** Default basal rates are programmed on the pump as defined in the current active profile. As long as AAPS is operational, it will send temporary basal rate commands that run for a maximum of 120 minutes. If for some reason the pump does not receive any new commands (for instance because communication was lost due to pump - phone distance) the pump will fall back to the default basal rate programmed on the pump once the Temporary Basal Rate ends.

**30 min Basal Rate Profiles are NOT supported in AAPS.** **The AAPS Profile does not support a 30 minute basal rate time frame** If you are new to AAPS and are setting up your basal rate profile for the first time, please be aware that basal rates starting on a half-hour basis are not supported, and you will need to adjust your basal rate profile to start on the hour. For example, if you have a basal rate of 1.1 units which starts at 09:30 and has a duration of 2 hours ending at 11:30, this will not work. You will need to change this 1.1 unit basal rate to a time range of either 9:00-11:00 or 10:00-12:00. Even though the Medtrum pump hardware itself supports the 30 min basal rate profile increments, AAPS is not able to take them into account with its algorithms currently.

**0U/h profile basal rates are NOT supported in AAPS** While the Medtrum pump does support a zero basal rate, AAPS uses multiples of the profile basal rate to determine automated treatment and therefore cannot function with a zero basal rate. A temporary zero basal rate can be achieved through the "Disconnect pump" function or through a combination of Disable Loop/Temp Basal Rate or Suspend Loop/Temp Basal Rate.

## Sąranka

CAUTION: When activating a patch with AAPS you **MUST** disable all other devices that can talk to the Medtrum pumpbase. e.g. active PDM and Medtrum app. Make sure you have your pumpbase and pumpbase SN ready for activation of a new patch.

### Step 1: Select Medtrum pump

#### Option 1: New installations

If you are installing AAPS for the first time, the **Setup Wizard** will guide you through installing AAPS. Select “Medtrum” when you reach Pump selection.

If in doubt you can also select “Virtual Pump” and select “Medtrum” later, after setting up AAPS (see option 2).

![Setup Wizard](../images/medtrum/SetupWizard.png)

#### Option 2: The Config Builder

On an existing installation you can select the **Medtrum** pump from the [Config Builder](Config-Builder.md#config-builder-profile):

On the top-left hand corner **hamburger menu** select **Config Builder**\ ➜\ **Pump**\ ➜\ **Medtrum**\ by selecting the **Enable button** titled **Medtrum**.

Selecting the **checkbox** next to the **Settings Gear** will allow the Medtrum overview to be displayed as a tab in the AAPS interface titled **Medtrum**. Checking this box will facilitate your access to the Medtrum commands when using AAPS and is highly recommended.

![Konfigūracija](../images/medtrum/ConfigBuilder.png)

### Step 2: Change Medtrum settings

Enter the Medtrum settings by tapping the **Settings Gear** of the Medtrum module in the Config Builder .

![Medtrum Settings](../images/medtrum/MedtrumSettings.png)

#### Serial Number:

Enter the serial number of your pumpbase here as noted on the pumpbase. Make sure the serial number is correct and there are no spaces added (You can either use capital or lowercase).

NOTE: This setting can only be changed when there is no patch active.

#### Alarm settings

***Default: Beep.***

This setting changes the way that the pump will alert you when there is a warning or error.

- Beep > The patch will beep on alarms and warnings
- Silent > The patch will not alert you on alarms and warnings

Note: In silent mode AAPS will still sound the alarm depending on your phone's volume settings. If you do not respond to the alarm, the patch will eventually beep.

#### Notification on pump warning

***Default: Enabled.***

This settings changes the way AAPS will show notification on non ciritical pump warnings. When enabled a Notification will be shown on the phone when a pump warning occurs, including:
    - Low battery
    - Low reservoir (20 Units)
    - Patch expiration warning

In either case these warnings are also shown on the Medtrum overview screen under [Active alarms](#active-alarms).

#### Patch Expiration

***Default: Enabled.***

This setting changes the behavior of the patch. When enabled the patch will expire after 3 days and give an audible warning if you have sound enabled. After 3 days and 8 hours the patch will stop working.

If this setting is disabled, the patch will not warn you and will continue running until the patch battery or reservoir runs out.

#### Pump expiry warning

***Default: 72 hours.***

This setting changes the time of the expiration warning, when [Patch Expiration](#patch-expiration) is enabled, AAPS will give a notification on the set hour after activation.

#### Hourly Maximum Insulin

***Default: 25U.***

This setting changes the maximum amount of insulin that can be delivered in one hour. If this limit is exceeded the patch will suspend and give an alarm. The alarm can be reset by pressing the reset button on in the overview menu see [Reset alarms](#reset-alarms).

Set this to a sensible value for your insulin requirements.

#### Daily Maximum Insulin

***Default: 80U.***

This setting changes the maximum amount of insulin that can be delivered in one day. If this limit is exceeded the patch will suspend and give an alarm. The alarm can be reset by pressing the reset button on in the overview menu see [Reset alarms](#reset-alarms).

Set this to a sensible value for your insulin requirements.

### Step 2b: AAPS Alerts settings

Go to preferences

#### Pump:

##### BT Watchdog

Go to preferences and select **Pump**:

![BT Watchdog](../images/medtrum/BTWatchdogSetting.png)

##### BT Watchdog

This setting will try to work around any BLE issues. It will try to reconnect to the pump when the connection is lost. It will also try to reconnect to the pump when the pump is unreachable for a certain amount of time.

Enable this setting if you experience frequent connection issues with your pump.

#### Local Alerts:

Go to preferences and select **Local Alerts**:

![Local Alerts](../images/medtrum/LocalAlertsSettings.png)

##### Alert if pump is unreachable

***Default: Enabled.***

This setting is forced to enabled when the Medtrum driver is enabled. It will alert you when the pump is unreachable. This can happen when the pump is out of range or when the pump is not responding due to a defective patch or pumpbase, for example when water leaks between the pumpbase and the patch.

For safety reasons this setting cannot be disabled.

##### Pump unreachable threshold [min]

***Default: 30 min.***

This setting changes the time after which AAPS will alert you when the pump is unreachable. This can happen when the pump is out of range or when the pump is not responding due to a defective patch or pumpbase, for example when water leaks between the pumpbase and the patch.

This setting can be changed when using Medtrum pump but it is recommended to set it at 30 minutes for safety reasons.

### Step 3: Activate patch

**Before you continue:**
- Have your Medtrum Nano pumpbase and a reservoir patch ready.
- Make sure that AAPS is properly set up and a [profile is activated](../Usage/Profiles.md).
- Other devices that can talk to the Medtrum pump are disabled (PDM and Medtrum app)

#### Activate patch from the Medtrum overview Tab

Navigate to the [Medtrum TAB](#overview) in the AAPS interface and press the **Change Patch** button in the bottom right corner.

If a patch is already active, you will be prompted to deactivate this patch first. see [Deactivate Patch](#deactivate-patch).

Follow the prompts to fill and activate a new patch. Please note - it is important to only connect the pumpbase to the reservoir patch at the step when you are prompted to do so. **You must only put the pump on your body and insert the cannula when prompted to during the activation process (after priming is complete).**

##### Start Activation

![Start Activation](../images/medtrum/activation/StartActivation.png)

At this step, double check your serial number and make sure the pumpbase is not connected to the patch yet.

Press **Next** to continue.

##### Fill the patch

![Fill the patch](../images/medtrum/activation/FillPatch.png)

Once the patch is detected and filled with a minimum of 70Units of insulin, press **Next** will appear.

##### Prime the patch

![Half press](../images/medtrum/activation/HalfPress.png)

Do not remove the safety lock and press the needle button on the patch.

Press **Next** to start prime

![Prime progress](../images/medtrum/activation/PrimeProgress.png)

![Prime complete](../images/medtrum/activation/PrimeComplete.png)

### Deactivate patch

To deactivate a currently active patch, go to the [Medtrum TAB](#overview) in the AAPS interface and press the **Change Patch** button.

![Deactivate patch](../images/medtrum/activation/DeactivatePatch.png)

You will be asked to confirm that you wish to deactivate the current patch. **Please note that this action is not reversable.** When deactivation is completed, you can press **Next** to continue the process to activate a new patch. If you are not ready to activate a new patch, press **Cancel** to return to the main screen.

![Deactivate progress](../images/medtrum/activation/DeactivateProgress.png)

If Android APS in unable to deactivate the patch (For instance because the pumpbase has already been removed from the reservoir patch), you may press **Discard** to forget the current patch session and make it possible to activate a new patch.

![Deactivate complete](../images/medtrum/activation/DeactivateComplete.png)

Once deactivation is complete, press **OK** to return to main screen or press **Next** to continue the process to activate a new patch.

### Resume interrupted activation

If a patch activation is interrupted, for instance because the phone battery runs out, you can resume the activation process by going to the [Medtrum TAB](#overview) in the AAPS interface and press the **Change Patch** button.

![Resume interrupted activation](../images/medtrum/activation/ActivationInProgress.png)

Press **Next** to continue the activation process. Press **Discard** to discard the current patch session and make it possible to activate a new patch.

![Reading activation status](../images/medtrum/activation/ReadingActivationStatus.png)

The driver will try to determine the current status of the patch activation. If this was successful it will go into the activation progress at the current step.

## Trikčių šalinimas

### Connection issues

If you are experiencing connection timeouts or other connection issues:
- In Android application settings for AAPS: Set location permission to "Allow all the time".

### Activation interrupted

If the activation process is interrupted for example by and empty phone battery or phone crash. The activation process can be resumed by going to the change patch screen and follow the steps to resume the activation as outlined here: [Resume interrupted activation](#resume-interrupted-activation)

### Preventing patch faults

The patch can give a variety of errors. To prevent frequent errors:
- Make sure the pumpbase is properly seated in the patch and no gaps are visible.
- When filling the patch do not apply excessive force to the plunger. Do not try to fill the patch beyond the maximum that applies to your model.

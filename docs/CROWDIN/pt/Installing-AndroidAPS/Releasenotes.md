# Notas das Versões

Please follow the instructions in the [update manual](../Installing-AndroidAPS/Update-to-new-version.md). You can also find a troubleshooting section addressing the most common difficulties when updating on the update manual page.

You will receive the following information as soon as a new update is available:

```{image} ../images/AAPS_LoopDisable90days.png
:alt: Update info
```

Depois tem 60 dias para atualizar. If you do not update within these 60 days AAPS will fall back to LGS (low glucose suspend - see [glossary](../Getting-Started/Glossary.md)) as in [objective 6](../Usage/Objectives.html).

If you do not update for another 30 days (90 days from new release date) AAPS will switch to Open Loop.

Please understand that this change is not intended to bug you but is due to safety reasons. New versions of AndroidAPS do not only provide new features but also important safety fixes. Therefore it is necessary that every user updates a.s.a.p.. Unfortunately there are still bug reports from very old versions so this is a try to improve safety for every single user and the whole DIY community. Thanks for your understanding.

## Android version and AAPS version

If your smartphone uses an Android Version older than Android 9 you will not be able to use AAPS v3 and up as it requires at least Android 9.

In order to allow users with older Android to use older version of AAPS new versions were pushed which only change version verification. No other improvements are included.

### Android 9 and up

- Use latest AAPS version
- Download AAPS Code from <https://github.com/nightscout/AndroidAPS>

### Android 8

- Use AAPS version **2.8.2.1**
- Download AAPS Code from <https://github.com/nightscout/AndroidAPS> branch 2.8.2.1

### Android 7

- Use AAPS version **2.6.2**
- Download AAPS Code from <https://github.com/nightscout/AndroidAPS> branch 2.6.2

## Version 3.1.0

Release date: 19-07-2022

## Version 3.0.0

Data de lançamento: 31-01-2022

(important-hints-3-0-0)=
### Notas importantes

- **Minimum Android version is 9.0 now.**
- **Data is not migrated to new database.** Do not complain, it's so huge change so it's simply not possible. Thus after update IOB, COB, treatments etc. will be cleared. You have to create new [profile switch](../Usage/Profiles.md) and start with zero IOB and COB. Planeie a atualização com cuidado!!! A melhor ocasião será sem insulina ativa e hidratos de carbono
- Use the same version of AAPS and NSClient

**Make sure to check and adjust settings after updating to 3.0 as described** [here](../Installing-AndroidAPS/update3_0.md).

### Passos preparatórios

**At least two days before update:**

- disable Dexcom bridge in Nightscout
- if you are using G5/G6 and xDrip as a collector, you have to update xDrip to a nightly version newer than 14th January 2022
- if you are using G5/G6 switching to BYODA as collector is recommended to take advantage of back-smoothing (you can still use xDrip for other purposes, xDrip can receive data from BYODA)

### Notas importantes

- Option **NS_UPLOAD_ONLY** has been forced ON for all 2.8.1 users.

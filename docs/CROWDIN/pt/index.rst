Welcome to the Android APS documentation
==============================================

**What is AndroidAPS?**

AndroidAPS is an app that can communicate with bluetooth-enabled insulin pumps, and runs a version of the OpenAPS "oref0" and "oref1" algorithms.

**Primary goals behind AndroidAPS:**

* modular app where it is possible and easy to add new modules without touching the rest of the code
* app that allows localization
* app where it is easy to select what will be included in final apk with an easy change and compilation
* app which supports open and closed APS mode
* app where you can see how APS works: input params, result and final decision
* ability to add more APS algorithms and let the user decide what to use
* app which is independent from a pump driver and contains a "Virtual pump" to allow users to safely play with APS
* app with tight Nightscout integration
* app where is easy to add/remove constraints for user safety
* all-in-one app for managing T1D with APS and Nightscout

**What you need to get started:**

* An Android Smartphone with Android 5.0 or later. See `this spreadsheet <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gZAsN6f0gv6tkgy9EBsYl0BQNhna0RDqA9QGycAqCQc/edit?usp=sharing>`_ for reports on how well a phone works with AndroidAPS.
* An app to receive CGM data: `xDrip <http://stephenblackwasalreadytaken.github.io/xDrip/>`_/ `xDrip+ <https://jamorham.github.io/#xdrip-plus>`_, `Glimp <https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=it.ct.glicemia>`_ , `G5 patched app <https://github.com/dexcomapp/dexcomapp>`_, `PochTech app <https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=jp.co.unitec.concretemanagement&hl=gsw>`_ or `600SeriesAndroidUploader <http://pazaan.github.io/600SeriesAndroidUploader/>`_
* `AndroidAPS <https://github.com/MilosKozak/AndroidAPS>`_ itself
* `Nightscout cgm-remote-monitor <http://www.nightscout.info/wiki/welcome/set-up-nightscout-using-heroku>`_ 0.10.2 or later
* A supported pump: Dana-R or Dana-RS Insulin Pump or Accu-Chek Combo (unless you build your own driver for another insulin pump)
* A Continuous Glucose Monitor (CGM) data source: Dexcom G4/G5/G6, Freestyle Libre, Eversense, Medtronic Guardian, PocTech

These instructions will assume that you are starting a new pod session; if this is not the case, please be patient and attempt to begin this process on your next pod change.

## Before You Begin

**SAFETY FIRST** - do not attempt this process in an environment where you cannot recover from an error (extra pods, insulin, charged RileyLink, and phone devices are must-haves).

**Your Omnipod PDM will no longer work after the AAPS Omnipod driver activates your pod**. Previously you used your Omnipod PDM to send commands to your Omnipod Eros pod. An Omnipod Eros pod only allows a single device to send communication to it. The device that successfully activates the pod is the only device allowed to communicate with it from that point forward. This means that once you activate an Omnipod Eros pod with your RileyLink through the AAPS Omnipod driver, **you will no longer be able to use your PDM with your pod**. The AAPS Omnipod driver with the RileyLink is now your acting PDM. *This does NOT mean you should throw away your PDM, it is recommended to keep it around as a backup, and for emergencies with AAPS is not working correctly.*

**You can configure multiple RileyLinks, but only one selected RileyLink at a time can communicate with a pod.** The AAPS Omnipod driver supports the ability to add multiple RileyLinks in the RileyLink configuration, however, only one RileyLink at a time can be selected to be used for sending and receiving communication.

**Your pod will not shut off when the RileyLink is out of range.** When your RileyLink is out of range or the signal is blocked from communicating with the active pod, your pod will continue to deliver basal insulin. Upon activating a pod, the basal profile defined in AAPS will be programmed into the new pod. Should you lose contact with the pod, it will revert to this basal profile. You will not be able to issue new commands until the RileyLink comes back in range and re-establishes the connection.

**30 min Basal Rate Profiles are NOT supported in AAPS.** If you are new to AAPS and are setting up your basal rate profile for the first time please be aware that basal rates starting on a half hour are not supported and you will need to adjust your basal rate profile to start on the hour. For example, if you have a basal rate of say 1.1 units which starts at 09:30 and has a duration of 2 hours ending at 11:30, this will not work.  You will need to update this 1.1 unit basal rate to a time range of either 9:00-11:00 or 10:00-12:00.  Even though the 30 min basal rate profile increments are supported by the Omnipod hardware itself, AAPS is not able to take them into account with its algorithms currently.

## Enabling the Omnipod Driver in AAPS

You can enable the Omnipod driver in AAPS in **two ways**:

### Option 1: The Setup Wizard

After installing a new version of AAPS, the **Setup Wizard** will start automatically.  This will also occur during in place upgrades.  If you already have exported your settings from a previous installation you can exit the Setup Wizard and import your old settings.  For new installations proceed below.

Via the **AAPS Setup Wizard (2)** located at the top right-hand corner **three-dot menu (1)** and proceeding through the wizard menus until you arrive at the **Pump** screen. Then select the **Omnipod radio button (3)** .

> ![Enable_Omnipod_Driver_1](../images/omnipod/Enable_Omnipod_Driver_1.png)  ![Enable_Omnipod_Driver_2](../images/omnipod/Enable_Omnipod_Driver_2.png)

On the same screen, below the pump selection, the **Omnipod Driver Settings** are displayed, under the **RileyLink Configuration** add your RileyLink device by pressing the **Not Set** text.

On the **RileyLink Selection** screen press the **Scan** button and select your RileyLink by scanning for all available Bluetooth devices and selecting your RileyLink from the list. When properly selected you are returned to the pump driver selection screen displaying the Omnipod driver settings showing your selected RileyLink with the MAC address listed.

Press the **Next** button to proceed with the rest of the **Setup Wizard.**  It can take up to one minute for the selected RileyLink to initialize and the **Next** button to become active.

Detailed steps on how to setup your pod communication device are listed below in the [RileyLink Setup Section](OmnipodEros-rileylink-setup).

**OR**

### Option 2: The Config Builder

Via the top-left hand corner **hamburger menu** under **Config Builder (1)** ➜**Pump**➜**Omnipod** by selecting the **radio button (2)** titled **Omnipod**. Selecting the **checkbox (4)** next to the **Settings Gear (3)** will display the Omnipod menu as a tab in the AAPS interface titled **POD**. This is referred to in this documentation as the **Omnipod (POD)** tab.

> **NOTE:** A faster way to access the **Omnipod settings** can be found below in the [Omnipod Settings section](OmnipodEros-omnipod-settings) of this document.
> 
> ![Enable_Omnipod_Driver_3](../images/omnipod/Enable_Omnipod_Driver_3.png) ![Enable_Omnipod_Driver_4](../images/omnipod/Enable_Omnipod_Driver_4.png)

### Verification of Omnipod Driver Selection

*Note: If you have exited the Setup Wizard early without selecting your RileyLink, the Omnipod Driver is enabled but you will still need to select your RileyLink.  You may see the Omnipod (POD) tab appear as it does below*

To verify that you have enabled the Omnipod driver in AAPS **swipe to the left** from the **Overview** tab, where you will now see an **Omnipod** or **POD** tab.

![Enable_Omnipod_Driver_5](../images/omnipod/Enable_Omnipod_Driver_5.png)

## Omnipod Configuration

Please **swipe left** to the **Omnipod (POD)** tab where you will be able to manage all pod and RileyLink functions (some of these functions are not enabled or visible without an active pod session):

> ![refresh_pod_status](../images/omnipod/ICONS/omnipod_overview_refresh_pod_status.png) Refresh Pod connectivity and status

> ![pod_management](../images/omnipod/ICONS/omnipod_overview_pod_management.png) Pod Management (Activate, Deactivate, Play test beep, RileyLink Stats and Pod history)

(OmnipodEros-rileylink-setup)=

### RileyLink Setup

If you already successfully paired your RileyLink in the Setup Wizard or steps above, then proceed to the [Activating a Pod Section](OmnipodEros-activating-a-pod) below.

*Note: A good visual indicator that the RileyLink is not connected is that the Insulin and Calculator buttons on the HOME tab will be missing. This will also occur for about the first 30 seconds after AAPS starts, as it is actively connecting to the RileyLink.*

1. Ensure that your RileyLink is fully charged and powered on.

2. After selecting the Omnipod driver, identify and select your RileyLink from **Config Builder (1)** ➜**Pump**➜**Omnipod**➜**Gear Icon (Settings) (2)** ➜**RileyLink Configuration (3)** by pressing the **Not Set** or **MAC Address (if present)** text.

   > Ensure your RileyLink battery is charged and it is [positioned in close proximity](OmnipodEros-optimal-omnipod-and-rileylink-positioning) (~30 cm away or less) to your phone for AAPS to identify it by its MAC address. Once selected, you can proceed to activate your first pod session. Use the back button on your phone to return to the main AAPS interface.
   > 
   > ![RileyLink_Setup_1](../images/omnipod/RileyLink_Setup_1.png) ![RileyLink_Setup_2](../images/omnipod/RileyLink_Setup_2.png)

3. On the **RileyLink Selection** screen press the **Scan (4)** button to initiate a bluetooth scan. **Select your RileyLink (5)**  from the list of available Bluetooth devices.

   > ![RileyLink_Setup_3](../images/omnipod/RileyLink_Setup_3.png) ![RileyLink_Setup_4](../images/omnipod/RileyLink_Setup_4.png)

4. After successful selection you are returned to the Omnipod Settings page listing your **currently selected RileyLink's MAC Address (6).**

   > ![RileyLink_Setup_5](../images/omnipod/RileyLink_Setup_5.png)

5. Verify that in the **Omnipod (POD)** tab that the **RileyLink Status (1)** appears as **Connected.** The **Pod status (2)** field should show **No active Pod**; if not, please attempt the previous step or exit AAPS to see if this refreshes the connection.

   > ![RileyLink_Setup_6](../images/omnipod/RileyLink_Setup_6.png)

(OmnipodEros-activating-a-pod)=

### Activating a Pod

Before you can activate a pod please ensure you have properly configured and connected your RileyLink connection in the Omnipod settings

*REMINDER: Pod communication occurs at limited ranges for pod activation pairing due to security safety measures. Before pairing the Pod's radio signal is weaker, however after it has been paired it will operate at full signal power. During these procedures, make sure that your pod is* [within close proximity](OmnipodEros-optimal-omnipod-and-rileylink-positioning) (~30 cm away or less) but not on top of or right next to the RileyLink.\*

01. Navigate to the **Omnipod (POD)** tab and click on the **POD MGMT (1)** button, and then click on **Activate Pod (2)**.

    > ![Activate_Pod_1](../images/omnipod/Activate_Pod_1.png) ![Activate_Pod_2](../images/omnipod/Activate_Pod_2.png)

02. The **Fill Pod** screen is displayed. Fill a new pod with at least 80 units of insulin and listen for two beeps indicating that the pod is ready to be primed. When calculating the total amount of insulin you need for 3 days, please take into account that priming the pod will use 12 to 15 units.

    > ![Activate_Pod_3](../images/omnipod/Activate_Pod_3.png)
    > 
    > Ensure the new pod and RileyLink are within close proximity of each other (~30cm or less) and click the **Next** button.

03. On the **Initialize Pod** screen, the pod will begin priming (you will hear a click followed by a series of ticking sounds as the pod primes itself). If RileyLink is out of range of the pod being activated, you will receive an error message **No response from Pod**. If this occurs, [move the RileyLink closer](OmnipodEros-optimal-omnipod-and-rileylink-positioning) (~30 cm away or less) to but not on top of or right next to the Pod and click the **Retry (1)** button.

    > ![Activate_Pod_4](../images/omnipod/Activate_Pod_4.png) ![Activate_Pod_5](../images/omnipod/Activate_Pod_5.png)

04. Upon successful priming a green checkmark will be shown and the **Next** button will become enabled. Click on the **Next** button to complete the pod priming initialization and display the **Attach Pod** screen.

    > ![Activate_Pod_6](../images/omnipod/Activate_Pod_6.png)

05. Next, prepare the infusion site of the new pod. Remove the pod's plastic needle cap and white paper backing from the adhesive and apply the pod to your usually selected site on your body. When finished, click on the **Next** button.

    > ![Activate_Pod_7](../images/omnipod/Activate_Pod_7.png)

06. The **Attach Pod** dialog box will now appear. **ONLY click on the OK button if you are ready to deploy the cannula**.

    > ![Activate_Pod_8](../images/omnipod/Activate_Pod_8.png)

07. After pressing **OK**, it may take some time before the Omnipod responds and inserts the cannula (1-2 minutes maximum), so be patient.

    > If RileyLink is out of range of the pod being activated, you will receive an error message **No response from Pod**. If this occurs, move the RileyLink closer (~30 cm away or less) to but not on top of or right next to the Pod and click the **Retry** button.
    > 
    > If the RileyLink is out of Bluetooth range or does not have an active connection to the phone, you will receive an error message **No response from RileyLink**. If this occurs, move the RileyLink closer to the phone and click the **Retry** button.
    > 
    > *NOTE: Before the cannula is inserted, it is good practice to pinch the skin near the cannula insertion point. This ensures a smooth insertion of the needle and will decrease your chances of developing occlusions.*

    > ![Activate_Pod_9](../images/omnipod/Activate_Pod_9.png)
    > 
    > ![Activate_Pod_10](../images/omnipod/Activate_Pod_10.png) ![Activate_Pod_11](../images/omnipod/Activate_Pod_11.png)

08. A green checkmark appears, and the **Next** button becomes enabled upon successful cannula insertion. Click on the **Next** button.

    > ![Activate_Pod_12](../images/omnipod/Activate_Pod_12.png)

09. The **Pod activated** screen is displayed. Click on the green **Finished** button. Congratulations! You have now started a new active pod session.

    > ![Activate_Pod_13](../images/omnipod/Activate_Pod_13.png)

10. The **Pod management** menu screen should now display with the **Activate Pod (1)** button *disabled* and the **Deactivate Pod (2)** button *enabled*. This is because a pod is now active and you cannot activate an additional pod without deactivating the currently active pod first.

    Click on the back button on your phone to return to the **Omnipod (POD)** tab screen which will now display Pod information for your active pod session, including current basal rate, pod reservoir level, insulin delivered, pod errors and alerts.

    For more details on the information displayed go to the [Omnipod (POD) Tab](OmnipodEros-omnipod-pod-tab) section of this document.

    ![Activate_Pod_14](../images/omnipod/Activate_Pod_14.png) ![Activate_Pod_15](../images/omnipod/Activate_Pod_15.png)

### Deactivating a Pod

Under normal circumstances, the life of a pod should run for three days (72 hours) and an additional 8 hours after the pod expiration warning for a total of 80 hours of pod usage.

To deactivate a pod (either from expiration or from a pod failure):

1. Go to the **Omnipod (POD)** tab, click on the **POD MGMT (1)** button, on the **Pod management** screen click on the **Deactivate Pod (2)** button.

   > ![Deactivate_Pod_1](../images/omnipod/Deactivate_Pod_1.png) ![Deactivate_Pod_2](../images/omnipod/Deactivate_Pod_2.png)

2. On the **Deactivate Pod** screen, first, make sure the RileyLink is in close proximity to the pod but not on top of or right next to the pod, then click on the **Next** button to begin the process of deactivating the pod.

   > ![Deactivate_Pod_3](../images/omnipod/Deactivate_Pod_3.png)

3. The **Deactivating Pod** screen will appear, and you will receive a confirmation beep from the pod that deactivation was successful.

   > ![Deactivate_Pod_4](../images/omnipod/Deactivate_Pod_4.png)
   > 
   > **IF deactivation fails** and you do not receive a confirmation beep, you may receive a **No response from RileyLink** or **No response from Pod message**. Please click on the **Retry (1)** button to attempt deactivation again. If deactivation continues to fail, please click on the **Discard Pod (2)** button to discard the Pod. You may now remove your pod as the active session has been deactivated. If your Pod has a screaming alarm, you may need to manually silence it (using a pin or a paperclip) as the **Discard Pod (2)** button will not silence it.
   > 
   > > ![Deactivate_Pod_5](../images/omnipod/Deactivate_Pod_5.png)  ![Deactivate_Pod_6](../images/omnipod/Deactivate_Pod_6.png)

4. A green checkmark will appear upon successful deactivation. Click on the **Next** button to display the pod deactivated screen. You may now remove your pod as the active session has been deactivated.

   > ![Deactivate_Pod_7](../images/omnipod/Deactivate_Pod_7.png)

5. Click on the green button to return to the **Pod management** screen.

   > ![Deactivate_Pod_8](../images/omnipod/Deactivate_Pod_8.png)

6. You are now returned to the **Pod management** menu press the back button on your phone to return to the **Omnipod (POD)** tab. Verify that the **RileyLink Status:** field reports **Connected** and the **Pod status:** field displays a **No active Pod** message.

   > ![Deactivate_Pod_9](../images/omnipod/Deactivate_Pod_9.png)  ![Deactivate_Pod_10](../images/omnipod/Deactivate_Pod_10.png)

### Suspending and Resuming Insulin Delivery

The process below will show you how to suspend and resume insulin pump delivery.

*NOTE - if you do not see a SUSPEND button*, then it has not been enabled to display in the Omnipod (POD) tab. Enable the **Show Suspend Delivery button in Omnipod tab** setting in the [Omnipod settings](OmnipodEros-omnipod-settings) under **Other**.

#### Suspending Insulin Delivery

Use this command to put the active pod into a suspended state. In this suspended state, the pod will no longer deliver any insulin. This command mimics the suspend function that the original Omnipod PDM issues to an active pod.

1. Go to the **Omnipod (POD)** tab and click on the **SUSPEND (1)** button. The suspend command is sent from the RileyLink to the active pod and the **SUSPEND (3)** button will become greyed out. The **Pod status (2)** will display **SUSPEND DELIVERY**.

   > ![Suspend_Insulin_Delivery_1](../images/omnipod/Suspend_Insulin_Delivery_1.png) ![Suspend_Insulin_Delivery_2](../images/omnipod/Suspend_Insulin_Delivery_2.png)

2. When the suspend command is successfully confirmed by the RileyLink a confirmation dialog will display the message **All insulin delivery has been suspended**. Click **OK** to confirm and proceed.

   > ![Suspend_Insulin_Delivery_3](../images/omnipod/Suspend_Insulin_Delivery_3.png)

3. Your active pod has now suspended all insulin delivery. The **Omnipod (POD)** tab will update the **Pod status (1)** to **Suspended**. The **SUSPEND** button will change to a new **Resume Delivery (2)** button

   > ![Suspend_Insulin_Delivery_4](../images/omnipod/Suspend_Insulin_Delivery_4.png)

#### Resuming Insulin Delivery

Use this command to instruct the active, currently suspended pod to resume insulin delivery. After the command is successfully processed, insulin will resume normal delivery using the current basal rate based on the current time from the active basal profile. The pod will again accept commands for bolus, TBR, and SMB.

1. Go to the **Omnipod (POD)** tab and ensure the **Pod status (1)** field displays **Suspended**, then press the **Resume Delivery (2)** button to start the process to instruct the current pod to resume normal insulin delivery. A message **RESUME DELIVERY** will display in the **Pod status (3)** field, signifying the RileyLink is actively sending the command to the suspended pod.

   > ![Resume_Insulin_Delivery_1](../images/omnipod/Resume_Insulin_Delivery_1.png) ![Resume_Insulin_Delivery_2](../images/omnipod/Resume_Insulin_Delivery_2.png)

2. When the Resume delivery command is successfully confirmed by the RileyLink a confirmation dialog will display the message **Insulin delivery has been resumed**. Click **OK** to confirm and proceed.

   > ![Resume_Insulin_Delivery_3](../images/omnipod/Resume_Insulin_Delivery_3.png)

3. The **Omnipod (POD)** tab will update the **Pod status (1)** field to display **RUNNING,** and the **Resume Delivery** button will now display the **SUSPEND (2)** button.

   > ![Resume_Insulin_Delivery_4](../images/omnipod/Resume_Insulin_Delivery_4.png)

### Acknowledging Pod Alerts

*NOTE - if you do not see an ACK ALERTS button, it is because it is conditionally displayed on the Omnipod (POD) tab ONLY when the pod expiration or low reservoir alert has been triggered.*

The process below will show you how to acknowledge and dismiss pod beeps that occur when the active pod time reaches the warning time limit before the pod expiration of 72 hours (3 days). This warning time limit is defined in the **Hours before shutdown** Omnipod alerts setting. The maximum life of a pod is 80 hours (3 days 8 hours), however Insulet recommends not exceeding the 72 hour (3 days) limit.

*NOTE - If you have enabled the "Automatically acknowledge Pod alerts" setting in Omnipod Alerts, this alert will be handled automatically after the first occurrence and you will NOT need to manually dismiss the alert.*

1. When the defined **Hours before shutdown** warning time limit is reached, the pod will issue warning beeps to inform you that it is approaching its expiration time and a pod change will soon be required. You can verify this on the **Omnipod (POD)** tab, the **Pod expires: (1)** field will show the exact time the pod will expire (72 hours after activation) and the text will turn **red** after this time has passed, under the **Active Pod alerts (2)** field where the status message **Pod will expire soon** is displayed. This trigger will display the **ACK ALERTS (3)** button. A **system notification (4)** will also inform you of the upcoming pod expiration

   > ![Acknowledge_Alerts_1](../images/omnipod/Acknowledge_Alerts_1.png) ![Acknowledge_Alerts_2](../images/omnipod/Acknowledge_Alerts_2.png)

2. Go to the **Omnipod (POD)** tab and press the **ACK ALERTS (2)** button (acknowledge alerts). The RileyLink sends the command to the pod to deactivate the pod expiration warning beeps and updates the **Pod status (1)** field with **ACKNOWLEDGE ALERTS**.

   > ![Acknowledge_Alerts_3](../images/omnipod/Acknowledge_Alerts_3.png)

3. Upon **successful deactivation** of the alerts, **2 beeps** will be issued by the active pod and a confirmation dialog will display the message **Activate alerts have been acknowledged**. Click the **OK** button to confirm and dismiss the dialog.

   > ![Acknowledge_Alerts_4](../images/omnipod/Acknowledge_Alerts_4.png)
   > 
   > If the RileyLink is out of range of the pod while the acknowledge alerts command is being processed a warning message will display 2 options. **Mute (1)** will silence this current warning. **OK (2)** will confirm this warning and allow the user to try to acknowledge alerts again.
   > 
   > ![Acknowledge_Alerts_5](../images/omnipod/Acknowledge_Alerts_5.png)

4. Go to the **Omnipod (POD)** tab, under the **Active Pod alerts** field, the warning message is no longer displayed and the active pod will no longer issue pod expiration warning beeps.

(OmnipodEros-view-pod-history)=

### View Pod History

This section shows you how to review your active pod history and filter by different action categories. The pod history tool allows you to view the actions and results committed to your currently active pod during its three day (72 - 80 hours) life.

This feature is useful for verifying boluses, TBRs, basal changes that were given but you may be unsure if they completed. The remaining categories are useful in general for troubleshooting issues and determining the order of events that occurred leading up to a failure.

*NOTE:* **Uncertain** commands will appear in the pod history, however due to their nature you cannot ensure their accuracy.

1. Go to the **Omnipod (POD)** tab and press the **POD MGMT (1)** button to access the **Pod management** menu and then press the **Pod history (2)** button to access the pod history screen.

   > ![Pod_History_1](../images/omnipod/Pod_History_1.png) ![Pod_History_2](../images/omnipod/Pod_History_2.png)

2. On the **Pod history** screen, the default category of **All (1)** is displayed showing the **Date and Time (2)** of all pod **Actions (3)** and **Results (4)** in reverse chronological order. Use your phone’s **back button 2 times** to return to the **Omnipod (POD)** tab in the main AAPS interface.

#### *Reset RileyLink Config Notes*

- The primary usage of this feature is when the currently active pod communication device is not responding and communication is in a stuck state.
- If the pod communication device is turned off and then back on, the **Reset RileyLink Config** button needs to be pressed, so that it sets these communication parameters in the pod communication device configuration.
- If this is NOT done then AAPS will need to be restarted after the pod communication device is power cycled.
- This button **DOES NOT** need to be pressed when switching between different pod communication devices

## Omnipod Settings

The Omnipod driver settings are configurable from the top-left hand corner **hamburger menu** under **Config Builder**➜**Pump**➜**Omnipod**➜**Settings Gear (2)** by selecting the **radio button (1)** titled **Omnipod**. Selecting the **checkbox (3)** next to the **Settings Gear (2)** will allow the Omnipod menu to be displayed as a tab in the AAPS interface titled **OMNIPOD** or **POD**. This is referred to in this documentation as the **Omnipod (POD)** tab.

![Omnipod_Settings_1](../images/omnipod/Omnipod_Settings_1.png)

**NOTE:** A faster way to access the **Omnipod settings** is by accessing the **3 dot menu (1)** in the upper right hand corner of the **Omnipod (POD)** tab and selecting **Omnipod preferences (2)** from the dropdown menu.

![Omnipod_Settings_2](../images/omnipod/Omnipod_Settings_2.png)

The settings groups are listed below; you can enable or disable via a toggle switch for most entries described below:

![Omnipod_Settings_3](../images/omnipod/Omnipod_Settings_3.png)

*NOTE: An asterisk (\*) denotes the default for a setting is enabled.*

### RileyLink

Allows for scanning of a pod communication device. The Omnipod driver cannot select more than one pod communication device at a time.

- **Show battery level reported by OrangeLink/EmaLink/DiaLink:** Reports the actual battery level of the OrangeLink/EmaLink/Dialink. It is **strongly recommended** that all OrangeLink/EmaLink/DiaLink users enable this setting.

- DOES NOT work with the original RileyLink.
- May not work with RileyLink alternatives.
- Enabled - Reports the current battery level for supported pod communication devices.
- Disabled - Reports a value of n/a.

- **Enable battery change logging in Actions:** In the Actions menu, the battery change button is enabled IF you have enabled this setting AND the battery reporting setting above.  Some pod communication devices now have the ability to use regular batteries which can be changed.  This option allows you to note that and reset battery age timers.

### Confirmation beeps

Provides confirmation beeps from the pod for bolus, basal, SMB, and TBR delivery and changes.

- **\*Bolus beeps enabled:** Enable or disable confirmation beeps when a bolus is delivered.

- **TBR beeps enabled:** Enable or disable confirmation beeps when a TBR is set or canceled.

### Alerts

Provides AAPS alerts and Nightscout announcements for pod expiration, shutdown, low reservoir based on the defined threshold units.

*Note an AAPS notification will ALWAYS be issued for any alert after the initial communication with the pod since the alert was triggered. Dismissing the notification will NOT dismiss the alert UNLESS automatically acknowledge Pod alerts is enabled. To MANUALLY dismiss the alert you must visit the Omnipod (POD) tab and press the ACK ALERTS button.*

- **\*Expiration reminder enabled:** Enable or disable the pod expiration reminder set to trigger when the defined number of hours before shutdown is reached.
- **Hours before shutdown:** Defines the number hours before the active pod shutdown occurs, which will then trigger the expiration reminder alert.
- **\*Low reservoir alert enabled:** Enable or disable an alert when the pod's remaining units low reservoir limit is reached as defined in the Number of units field.
- **Number of units:** The number of units at which to trigger the pod low reservoir alert.
- **Automatically acknowledge Pod alerts:** When enabled a notification will still be issued however immediately after the first pod communication contact since the alert was issued it will now be automatically acknowledged and the alert will be dismissed.

### Notifications

Provides AAPS notifications and audible phone alerts when it is uncertain if TBR, SMB, or bolus events were successful.

*NOTE: These are notifications only, no audible beep alerts are made.*

- **Sound for uncertain TBR notifications enabled:** Enable or disable this setting to trigger an audible alert and visual notification when AAPs is uncertain if a TBR was successfully set.

   > ![RileyLink_Setup_Add_3](../images/omnipod/RileyLink_Setup_Add_3.png) ![RileyLink_Setup_Add_4](../images/omnipod/RileyLink_Setup_Add_4.png)

## Actions (ACT) Tab

This tab is well documented in the main AAPS documentation but there are a few items on this tab that are specific to how the Omnipod pod differs from tube based pumps, especially after the processes of applying a new pod.

1. Go to the **Actions (ACT)** tab in the main AAPS interface.
2. Under the **Careportal (1)** section the following 3 fields will have their **age reset** to 0 days and 0 hours **after each pod change**: **Insulin** and **Cannula**. This is done because of how the Omnipod pump is built and operates. The **pump battery** and **insulin reservoir** are self contained inside of each pod. Since the pod inserts the cannula directly into the skin at the site of the pod application, a traditional tube is not used in Omnipod pumps. *Therefore after a pod change the age of each of these values will automatically reset to zero.* **Pump battery age** is not reported as the battery in the pod will always be more than the life of the pod (maximum 80 hours).

> ![Actions_Tab](../images/omnipod/Actions_Tab.png)

### Levels

**Insulin Level**

Reporting of the amount of insulin in the Omnipod Eros Pod is not exact.  This is because it is not known exactly how much insulin was put in the pod, only that when the 2 beeps are triggered while filling the pod that over 85 units have been injected. A Pod can hold a maximum of 200 units. Priming can also introduce variance as it is not and exact process.  With both of these factors, the Omnipod driver has been written to give the best approximation of insulin remaining in the reservoir.

> - **Above 50 Units** - Reports a value of 50+U when more than 50 units are currently in the reservoir.
> - **Below 50 Units** - Reports an approximate calculated value of insulin remaining in the reservoir.
> - **SMS** - Returns value or 50+U for SMS responses
> - **Nightscout** - Uploads value of 50 when over 50 units to Nightscout (version 14.07 and older).  Newer versions will report a value of 50+ when over 50 units.

**Battery Level**

Battery level reporting is a setting that can be enabled to return the current battery level of pod communication devices, such as the OrangeLink, EmaLink or DiaLink.  The RileyLink hardware is not capable of reporting its battery level.  The battery level is reported after each communication with the pod, so when charging a linear increase may not be observed.  A manual refresh will update the current battery level.  When a supported Pod communication device is disconnected a value of 0% will be reported.

> - **RileyLink hardware is NOT capable of reporting battery level**
> - **"Show battery level reported by OrangeLink/EmaLink/DiaLink" Setting MUST be enabled in the Omnipod settings to report battery level values**
> - **Battery level reporting ONLY works for OrangeLink, EmaLink and DiaLink Devices**
> - **Battery Level reporting MAY work for other devices (excluding RileyLink)**
> - **SMS** - Returns current battery level as a response when an actual level exists, a value of n/a will not be returned
> - **Nightscout** - Battery level is reported when an actual level exists, a value of n/a will not be reported

## Rozwiązywanie problemów

### Pod Failures

Pods fail occasionally due to a variety of issues, including hardware issues with the Pod itself. It is best practice not to call these into Insulet, since AAPS is not an approved use case. A list of fault codes can be found [here](https://github.com/openaps/openomni/wiki/Fault-event-codes) to help determine the cause.

### Preventing error 49 pod failures

This failure is related to an incorrect pod state for a command or an error during an insulin delivery command. We recommend users to switch to the Nightscout client to *upload only (Disable sync)* under the **Config Builder**➜**General**➜**NSClient**➜**cog wheel**➜**Advanced Settings** to prevent possible failures.

### Pump Unreachable Alerts

It is recommended that pump unreachable alerts be configured to **120 minutes** by going to the top right-hand side three-dot menu, selecting **Preferences**➜**Local Alerts**➜**Pump unreachable threshold \[min\]** and setting this to **120**.

(OmnipodEros-import-settings-from-previous-aaps)=
### Import Settings from previous AAPS

Please note that importing settings has the possibility to import an outdated Pod status. As a result, you may lose an active Pod. It is therefore strongly recommended that you **do not import settings while on an active Pod session**.

1. Deactivate your pod session. Verify that you do not have an active pod session.
2. Export your settings and store a copy in a safe place.
3. Uninstall the previous version of AAPS and restart your phone.
4. Install the new version of AAPS and verify that you do not have an active pod session.
5. Import your settings and activate your new pod.

### Omnipod driver alerts

please note that the Omnipod driver presents a variety of unique alerts on the **Overview tab**, most of them are informational and can be dismissed while some provide the user with an action to take to resolve the cause of the triggered alert. A summary of the main alerts that you may encounter is listed below:

#### No active Pod

No active Pod session detected. This alert can temporarily be dismissed by pressing **SNOOZE** but it will keep triggering as long as a new pod has not been activated. Once activated this alert is automatically silenced.

#### Pod suspended

Informational alert that Pod has been suspended.

#### Setting basal profile failed. Delivery might be suspended! Please manually refresh the Pod status from the Omnipod tab and resume delivery if needed..

Informational alert that the Pod basal profile setting has failed, and you will need to hit *Refresh* on the Omnipod tab.

#### Unable to verify whether SMB bolus succeeded. If you are sure that the Bolus didn't succeed, you should manually delete the SMB entry from Treatments.

Alert that the SMB bolus success could not be verified, you will need to verify the *Last bolus* field on the Omnipod tab to see if SMB bolus succeeded and if not remove the entry from the Treatments tab.

#### Uncertain if "task bolus/TBR/SMB" completed, please manually verify if it was successful.

Due to the way that the RileyLink and Omnipod communicate, situations can occur where it is *uncertain* if a command was successfully processed. The need to inform the user of this uncertainty was necessary.

Below are a few examples of when an uncertain notification can occur.

- **Boluses** - Uncertain boluses cannot be automatically verified. The notification will remain until the next bolus but a manual pod refresh will clear the message. *By default alerts beeps are enabled for this notification type as the user will manually need to verify them.*
- **TBRs, Pod Statuses, Profile Switches, Time Changes** - a manual pod refresh will clear the message. By default alert beeps are disabled for this notification type.
- **Pod Time Deviation -** When the time on the pod and the time your phone deviates too much then it is difficult for AAPS loop to function and make accurate predictions and dosage recommendations. If the time deviation between the pod and the phone is more than 5 minutes then AAPS will report the pod is in a Suspended state under Pod status with a HANDLE TIME CHANGE message. An additional **Set Time** icon will appear at the bottom of the Omnipod (POD) tab. Clicking Set Time will synchronize the time on the pod with the time on the phone and then you can click the RESUME DELIVERY button to continue normal pod operations.

## Best Practices

(OmnipodEros-optimal-omnipod-and-rileylink-positioning)=

### Optimal Omnipod and RileyLink Positioning

The antenna used on the RileyLink to communicate with an Omnipod pod is a 433 MHz helical spiral antenna. Due to its construction properties it radiates an omni directional signal like a three dimensional doughnut with the z-axis representing the vertical standing antenna. This means that there are optimal positions for the RileyLink to be placed, especially during pod activation and deactivation routines.

![Toroid_w_CS](../images/omnipod/Toroid_w_CS.png)

> *(Fig 1. Graphical plot of helical spiral antenna in an omnidirectional pattern*)

Because of both safety and security concerns, pod *activation* has to be done at a range *closer (~30 cm away or less)* than other operations such as giving a bolus, setting a TBR or simply refreshing the pod status. Due to the nature of the signal transmission from the RileyLink antenna it is NOT recommended to place the pod directly on top of or right next to the RileyLink.

The image below shows the optimal way to position the RileyLink during pod activation and deactivation procedures. The pod may activate in other positions but you will have the most success using the position in the image below.

*Note: If after optimally positioning the pod and RileyLink communication fails, this may be due to a low battery which decreases the transmission range of the RileyLink antenna. To avoid this issue make sure the RileyLink is properly charged or connected directly to a charging cable during this process.*

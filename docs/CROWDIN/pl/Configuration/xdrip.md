# xDrip+ settings

If not already set up, then download [xDrip+](https://jamorham.github.io/#xdrip-plus).

Disable battery optimization and allow background activity for the xDrip+ app.

You can safely download the [latest APK (stable)](https://xdrip-plus-updates.appspot.com/stable/xdrip-plus-latest.apk) unless you need recent features or are using sensors that are being actively integrated (like G7), in which case you should use the latest [Nightly Snapshot](https://github.com/NightscoutFoundation/xDrip/releases).

## Basic settings for all CGM & FGM systems

### Disable Nightscout upload

Starting with AAPS 3.2, you shouldn't let any other app upload data (blood glucose and treatments) to Nightscout.

→ Hamburger Menu (1) → Settings (2) → Cloud Upload (3) -> Nightscout Sync (REST-API)(4) → Switch **OFF** `Enabled` (5)

![xDrip+ Basic Settings 1](../images/xDrip_Basic1.png)

#### Disable automatic calibration and treatments

If you use an older version of AAPS (before 3.2), make sure to deactivate `Automatic Calibration` (7) If the checkbox for `Automatic Calibration` is checked, activate `Download treatments` (6) once, then remove the checkbox for `Automatic Calibration` and deactivate `Download treatments` again.

![xDrip+ Basic Settings 2](../images/xDrip_Basic2.png)

Tap `Extra Options`(8)

    {admonition} Safety warning
    :class: warning
    You must deactivate "Upload treatments" from xDrip+, otherwise treatments can be doubled in AAPS leading to false COB and IOB.

Deactivate `Upload treatments`(9) and make sure you will **NOT** use `Back-fill data` (11).

Option `Alert on failures` should also be deactivated (10). Otherwise you will get an alarm every 5 minutes in case Wi-Fi/mobile network issues or if the server is not available.

### **Inter-app Settings** (Broadcast)

If you are going to use AAPS and the data should be forwarded to i.e. AAPS you have to activate broadcasting in xDrip+ in Inter-App settings.

→ Hamburger Menu (1) → Settings (2) → Inter-app settings (3) → Broadcast locally **ON** (4)

In order for the values to be identical in AAPS with respect to xDrip+, you should activate `Send the displayed glucose value` (5).

Enable Compatible Broadcast (6).

![xDrip+ Basic Settings 4](../images/xDrip_Basic4.png)

If you have also activated `Accept treatments` in xDrip+ and `Enable broadcasts to xDrip+` in AAPS xDrip+ plugin, then xDrip+ will receive insulin, carbs and basal rate information from AAPS.

If you enable `Accept Calibrations`, xDrip+ will use the calibrations from AAPS. Be careful when you use this feature with Dexcom sensors: read [this](https://navid200.github.io/xDrip/docs/Calibrate-G6.html) first.

Remember to disable Import Sounds to avoid xDrip+ making a ringtone every time AAPS sends a basal/profile change.

![xDrip+ Basic Settings 5](../images/xDrip_Basic5.png)

(xdrip-identify-receiver)=

#### Identify receiver

- If you discover problems with local broadcast (AAPS not receiving BG values from xDrip+) go to → Hamburger Menu (1) Settings (2) → Inter-app settings (3) → Identify receiver (7) and enter `info.nightscout.androidaps` for AAPS build (if you are using PumpControl build, please enter `info.nightscout.aapspumpcontrol` instead!!).
- Pay attention: Auto-correction sometimes tend to change i to capital letter. You **must use only lowercase letters** when typing `info.nightscout.androidaps` (or `info.nightscout.aapspumpcontrol` for PumpControl). Capital I would prevent the App from receiving BG values from xDrip+.
    
    ![xDrip+ Basic Inter-app Settings Identify receiver](../images/xDrip_InterApp_NS.png)

## Use AAPS to calibrate in xDrip+

- If you want to be able to use AAPS to calibrate then in xDrip+ go to Settings → Interapp Compatibility → Accept Calibrations and select ON. 
- You may also want to review the options in Settings → Less Common Settings → Advanced Calibration Settings.

## Dexcom G6

- The Dexcom G6 transmitter can simultaneously be connected to the Dexcom receiver (or alternatively the t:slim pump) and one app on your phone.
- When using xDrip+ as receiver uninstall Dexcom app first. **You cannot connect xDrip+ and Dexcom app with the transmitter at the same time!**
- If you need Clarity and want to profit from xDrip+ features, use the [Build Your Own Dexcom App](DexcomG6-if-using-g6-with-build-your-own-dexcom-app) with local broadcast to xDrip+, or use xDrip+ as a Companion app receiving notifications from the official Dexcom app.

### xDrip+ version depending on G6 transmitter serial no.

- All G6 transmitters manufactured after fall/end 2018 are called "Firefly". They do not allow sensor restart without [removing the transmitter](https://navid200.github.io/xDrip/docs/Remove-transmitter.html), they do not send raw data. It is recommended to use the latest [Nightly Snapshot](https://github.com/NightscoutFoundation/xDrip/releases).
- Old rebatteried transmitters and modified trasmitters allow sensor life extension and restarts, they also send raw data. You can use the [latest APK (stable)](https://xdrip-plus-updates.appspot.com/stable/xdrip-plus-latest.apk).

### Dexcom specific settings

- Follow [these instructions](https://navid200.github.io/xDrip/docs/G6-Recommended-Settings.html) to setup xDrip+.

### Preemptive restarts not recommended

**Only rebatteried or modified Dexcom transmitters. [Preemptive restarts](https://navid200.github.io/xDrip/docs/Preemptive-Restart.html) do not work with standard transmitters and will stop the sensor completely: you need to [remove the transmitter](https://navid200.github.io/xDrip/docs/Remove-transmitter.html) to restart the sensor.**

The automatic extension of Dexcom sensors (`preemptive restarts`) is not recommended as this might lead to “jumps” in BG values on day 9 after restart.

![xDrip+ Jump after Preemptive Restart](../images/xDrip_Dexcom_PreemptiveJump.png)

To use it safely, there are a few points to be aware of:

- If you are using the native data with the calibration code in xDrip+ or Spike, the safest thing to do is not allow preemptive restarts of the sensor.
- If you must use preemptive restarts, then make sure you insert at a time of day where you can observe the change and calibrate if necessary. 
- If you are restarting sensors, either do it without the factory calibration for safest results on days 11 and 12, or ensure you are ready to calibrate and keep an eye on variation.
- Pre-soaking of the G6 with factory calibration is likely to give variation in results. Jeśli pracujesz z namaczaniem wstępnym, aby uzyskać najlepsze wyniki, prawdopodobnie będziesz musiał skalibrować sensor.
- If you aren’t being observant about the changes that may be taking place, it may be better to revert to non-factory-calibrated mode and use the system like a G5.

### Connect G6 transmitter for the first time

**For second and following transmitters see [Extend transmitter life](xdrip-extend-transmitter-life) below.**

Follow [these instructions](https://navid200.github.io/xDrip/docs/Starting-G6.html).

(xdrip-transmitter-battery-status)=

### Transmitter battery status

- Battery status can be controlled in system status  
    → Hamburger Menu (1) → System Status (2) → If you are on the Classic Status Page (3) swipe the screen (4) to reach → G5/G6/G7 Status screen.

![xDrip+ System status](../images/xDrip_Dexcom_Battery.png)

- See [here](https://navid200.github.io/xDrip/docs/Battery-condition.html) for more information.

(xdrip-extend-transmitter-life)=

### Extend transmitter life

- [Lifetime](https://navid200.github.io/xDrip/docs/Transmitter-lifetime.html) cannot be extended for Firefly transmitters: only rebatteried or modified transmitters.
- Follow [these instructions](https://navid200.github.io/xDrip/docs/Hard-Reset.html) for non-Firefly transmitters.

(xdrip-replace-transmitter)=

### Replace transmitter

- Turn original Dexcom receiver off (if used).
- [Stop sensor](https://navid200.github.io/xDrip/docs/Dexcom/StartG6Sensor.html) (only if replacing sensor).

- Forget device in xDrip+ system status AND in smartphone’s BT settings (Will be shown as Dexcom?? whereas ?? are the last two digits of the transmitter serial no.)  
    → Hamburger Menu (1) → System Status (2) → If you are on the Classic Status Page (3) swipe the screen (4) to reach → G5/G6/G7 Status screen → Forget Device (5).

![xDrip+ System status](../images/xDrip_Dexcom_StopSensor.png)

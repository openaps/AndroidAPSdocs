Please follow the instructions in the [update manual](../Installing-AndroidAPS/Update-to-new-version.md). You can also find a troubleshooting section addressing the most common difficulties when updating on the update manual page.

Starting with version 2.3 a new update procedure is established. You will receive the following information as soon as a new update is available:

![Update info](../images/AAPS_LoopDisable90days.png)

Then you have 60 days to update. If you do not update within these 60 days AAPS will fall back to LGS (low glucose suspend - see [glossary](../Getting-Started/Glossary.md)) as in [objective 4](../Usage/Objectives.md).

If you do not update for another 30 days (90 days from new release date) AAPS will switch to Open Loop.

Please understand that this change is not intended to bug you but is due to safety reasons. New versions of AndroidAPS do not only provide new features but also important safety fixes. Therefore it is neccessary that every user updates a.s.a.p.. Unfortunately there are still bug reports from very old versions so this is a try to improve safety for every single user and the whole DIY community. Thanks for your understanding.

### Settings to adjust when switching from AMA to SMB

* Objective 8 must be started for SMBs to be enabled (SMB tab generally shows what restrictions apply)
* maxIOB now includes *all* IOB, not just added basal. That is, if given a bolus of 8 U for a meal and maxIOB is 7 U, no SMBs will be delivered until IOB drops below 7 U.
* min_5m_carbimpact default has changed from 3 to 8 going from AMA to SMB. If you are upgrading from AMA to SMB, you have to change it manualy
* Note when building AndroidAPS 2.0 apk: Configuration on demand is not supported by the current version of the Android Gradle plugin! If your build fails with an error regarding "on demand configuration" you can do the following:
  
  * Open the Preferences window by clicking File > Settings (on Mac, Android Studio > Preferences).
  * In the left pane, click Build, Execution, Deployment > Compiler.
  * Uncheck the Configure on demand checkbox.
  * Click Apply or OK.

### Overview tab

* Top ribbon gives access to suspend/disable loop, view/adjust profile and to start/stop temporary targets (TTs). TTs use defaults set in preferences. The new Hypo TT option is a high temp TT to prevent the loop from too aggressively overcorrection rescue carbs.
* Treatment buttons: old treatment button still available, but hidden by default. Visibility of buttons can now be configured. New insulin button, new carbs button (including [eCarbs/extended carbs](../Usage/Extended-Carbs.md))
* Colored prediction lines:

  * Light blue: zero-temp
  * Dark yellow: UAM
* Option to show a notes field in insulin/carbs/calculator/prime+fill dialogs, which are uploaded to NS
* Updated prime/fill dialog allows priming and creating careportal entries for site change and cartridge change

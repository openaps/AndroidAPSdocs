# Pompa Accu-Chek Insight

**Oprogramowanie jest częścią rozwiązania DIY (Do It Yourself - Zrób to sam) sztucznej trzustki, nie jest to produkt komercyjny. Dlatego projekt wymaga od Ciebie abyś przeczytał, uczył się i rozumiał, jak system pracuje i jak go używać. System nie zwalnia Cię z podejmowania decyzji oraz ze wszystkich trudności związanych z leczeniem cukrzycy, ale jeśli jesteś skłonny zainwestować niezbędny czas, może poprawić wyniki terapii i poprawić jakość życia. Nie śpiesz się, daj sobie czas na naukę. Tylko Ty jesteś odpowiedzialny za to co robisz z systemem.**

## *** OSTRZEŻENIE: ** Jeśli wcześniej korzystałeś z Insight z ** SightRemote **, ** zaktualizuj do najnowszej wersji ** i ** odinstaluj SightRemote </0 >.</em></h2> 

## Wymagania sprzętowe i programowe

* A Roche Accu-Chek Insight pump (any firmware, they all work)

Note: AAPS will write data always in **first basal rate profile in the pump**.

* An Android phone (Basically every Android version would work with Insight, but check on the [Module](../Getting-Started/ComponentOverview) page which Android version is required to run AAPS.)
* The AAPS app installed on your phone

## Ustawienia

* The Insight pump should only be connected to one device at a time. If you have previously used the Insight remote control (meter), you must remove the meter from the paired devices list of your pump: Menu > Settings > Communication > Remove device
    
    ![Screenshot of Remove Meter Insight](../images/Insight_RemoveMeter.png)

* In [Config builder > Pump](../SettingUpAaps/ConfigBuilder.md), select Accu-Chek Insight.
    
    ![Screenshot of Config Builder Insight](../images/Insight_ConfigBuilder_AAPS3_0.jpg)

* Tap the cog-wheel to open Insight settings.

* In settings, tap on the button 'Insight pairing' at the top of the screen. You should see a list of all nearby bluetooth devices (below left).
* On the Insight pump, go to Menu > Settings > Communication > Add Device. The pump will display the following screen (below right) showing the serial number of the pump.
    
    ![Screenshot of Insight Pairing 1](../images/Insight_Pairing1.png)

* Going back to your phone, tap on the pump serial number in the list of bluetooth devices. Then tap on Pair to confirm.
    
    ![Screenshot of Insight Pairing 2](../images/Insight_Pairing2.png)

* Both the pump and phone will then display a code. Check that the codes are the same on both devices and confirm on both the pump and the phone.

* Success! Pat yourself on the back for successfully pairing your pump with AAPS.
    
    ![Screenshot of Insight Pairing 4](../images/Insight_Pairing4.png)

* To check all is well, go back to Config builder in AAPS and tap on the cog-wheel by the Insight Pump to get into Insight settings, then tap on Insight Pairing and you will see some information about the pump:
    
    ![Screenshot of Insight Pairing Information](../images/Insight_PairingInformation.png)

Note: There will be no permanent connection between pump and phone. A connection will only be established if necessary (i.e. setting temporary basal rate, giving bolus, reading pump history...). Otherwise battery of phone and pump would drain way too fast.

## Ustawienia w AAPS

**Note : It is now possible (only with AAPS v2.7.0 and above) to use ‘Always use basal absolute values’ if you want to use Autotune with Insight pump, even if 'sync is enabled' with Nightscout.** (In AAPS go to [Preferences > NSClient > Advanced Settings](#Preferences-advanced-settings-nsclient)).

![Screenshot of Insight Settings](../images/Insight_settings.png)

In the Insight settings in AAPS you can enable the following options:

* "Log reservoir changes": This will automatically record an insulin cartridge change when you run the "fill cannula" program on the pump.

* "Log tube changes": This adds a note to the AAPS database when you run the "tube filling" program on the pump.

* "Log site change": This adds a note to the AAPS database when you run the "cannula filling" program on the pump. **Note: A site change also resets Autosens.**

* "Log battery changes": This records a battery change when you put a new battery in the pump.

* "Log operating mode changes": This inserts a note in the AAPS database whenever you start, stop or pause the pump.

* "Log alerts": This records a note in the AAPS database whenever the pump issues an alert (except reminders, bolus and TBR cancellation - those are not recorded).

* "Enable TBR emulation": The Insight pump can only issue temporary basal rates (TBRs) up to 250%. To get round this restriction, TBR emulation will instruct the pump to deliver an extended bolus for the extra insulin if you request a TBR of more than 250%.
    
    **Note: Just use one extended bolus at a time as multiple extended boluses at the same time might cause errors.**

* "Disable vibrations on manual bolus delivery": This disables the Insight pump's vibrations when delivering a manual bolus (or extended bolus). This setting is available only with the latest version of Insight firmware (3.x).

* "Disable vibrations on automated bolus delivery": This disables the Insight pump's vibrations when delivering an automatic bolus (SMB or Temp basal with TBR emulation). This setting is available only with the latest version of Insight firmware (3.x).

* "Recovery duration": This defines how long AAPS will wait before trying again after a failed connection attempt. You can choose from 0 to 20 seconds. If you experience connection problems, choose a longer wait time.   
      
    Example for min. recovery duration = 5 and max. recovery duration = 20   
      
    no connection -> wait **5** sec.   
    retry -> no connection -> wait **6** sec.   
    retry -> no connection -> wait **7** sec.   
    retry -> no connection -> wait **8** sec.   
    ...   
    retry -> no connection -> wait **20** sec.   
    retry -> no connection -> wait **20** sec.   
    ...

* "Disconnect delay": This defines how long (in seconds) AAPS will wait to disconnect from the pump after an operation is finished. Default value is 5 seconds.

For periods when pump was stopped AAPS will log a temp. basal rate with 0%.

In AAPS, the Accu-Chek Insight tab shows the current status of the pump and has two buttons:

* "Refresh": Refreshes pump status
* "Enable/Disable TBR over notification": A standard Insight pump emits an alarm when a TBR is finished. This button lets you enable or disable this alarm without the need for configuration software.
    
    ![Screenshot of Insight Status](../images/Insight_Status2.png)

## Ustawienia w pompie

Configure alarms in the pump as follows:

* Menu > Settings > Device settings > Mode settings > Quiet > Signal > Sound
* Menu > Settings > Device settings > Mode settings > Quiet > Volume > 0 (remove all bars)
* Menu > Modes > Signal mode > Quiet

This will silence all alarms from the pump, allowing AAPS to decide if an alarm is relevant to you. If AAPS does not acknowledge an alarm, its volume will increase (first beep, then vibration).

### Vibration

Depending on the firmware version of your pump, the Insight will vibrate briefly every time a bolus is delivered (for example, when AAPS issues an SMB or TBR emulation delivers an extended bolus).

* Firmware 1.x: No vibration by design.
* Firmware 2.x: Vibration cannot be disabled.
* Firmware 3.x: AAPS delivers bolus silently. (minimum [version 2.6.1.4](#Releasenotes-version-2-6-1-4))

Firmware version can be found in the menu.

## Wymiana baterii

Battery life for Insight when looping range from 10 to 14 days, max. 20 days. The user reporting this is using Energizer lithium batteries.

The Insight pump has a small internal battery to keep essential functions like the clock running while you are changing the removable battery. If changing the battery takes too long, this internal battery may run out of power, the clock will reset, and you will be asked to enter a new time and date after inserting a new battery. If this happens, all entries in AAPS prior to the battery change will no longer be included in calculations as the correct time cannot be identified properly.

## Typowe błędy

### Bolus Przedłużony

Just use one extended bolus at a time as multiple extended boluses at the same time might cause errors.

### Time out

Sometimes it might happen that the Insight pump does not answer during connection setup. In this case AAPS will display the following message: "Timeout during handshake - reset bluetooth".

![Insight Reset Bluetooth](../images/Insight_ResetBT.png)

In this case turn off bluetooth on pump AND smartphone for about 10 seconds and then turn it back on.

    ## 3. Build the Signed APK
    
    Your sourcecode is now the current released version. It's time to build the signed apk from it as described in the [build signed apk section](#Building-APK-generate-signed-apk).
    
    (Update-to-new-version-transfer-and-install)=
    
    ## 4. Transfer and install the apk
    You need to transfer the apk to your phone so you can install it.
    
    ```{note}
    If you completed the build with the same existing key store in Android Studio, then you do not need to remove the existing app on your phone. When you install the apk, follow the prompts to install updates.
    For other scenarios such as establishing a new key store in Android Studio for your signed apk, you will need to delete the old app before installing the apk. **Make sure to export your settings!**
    

See the instructions for [transferring and installing AAPS](../SettingUpAaps/TransferringAndInstallingAaps.md)

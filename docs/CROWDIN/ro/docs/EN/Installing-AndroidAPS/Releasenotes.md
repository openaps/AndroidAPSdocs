# Release notes

Please follow the instructions in the [update manual](../Installing-AndroidAPS/Update-to-new-version.md). You can also find a troubleshooting section addressing the most common difficulties when updating on the update manual page.

You will receive the following information as soon as a new update is available:

![Update info](../images/AAPS_LoopDisable90days.png)

Then you have 60 days to update. If you do not update within these 60 days AAPS will fall back to LGS (low glucose suspend - see [glossary](../Getting-Started/Glossary.md)) as in [objective 6](../Usage/Objectives.html).

If you do not update for another 30 days (90 days from new release date) AAPS will switch to Open Loop.

Please understand that this change is not intended to bug you but is due to safety reasons. New versions of AAPS do not only provide new features but also important safety fixes. Therefore it is necessary that every user updates a.s.a.p.. Unfortunately there are still bug reports from very old versions so this is a try to improve safety for every single user and the whole DIY community. Thanks for your understanding.

```{admonition} First version of AAPS
:class: note

The first test version started already in 2015. In 2016 has been the first released version.

The chronology of these releases is not available at the moment but as this questions is asked severeal times we document it here.

```

## Android version and AAPS version

If your smartphone uses an Android Version older than Android 9 you will not be able to use AAPS v3 and up as it requires at least Android 9.

In order to allow users with older Android to use older version of AAPS new versions were pushed which only change version verification. No other improvements are included.

### Android 9 and up

- Use latest AAPS version
- Download AAPS Code from <https://github.com/nightscout/AndroidAPS>

### Android 8

- Use AAPS version **2.8.2.1**
- Download AAPS Code from <https://github.com/nightscout/AndroidAPS> branch 2.8.2.1

### Android 7

- Use AAPS version **2.6.2**
- Download AAPS Code from <https://github.com/nightscout/AndroidAPS> branch 2.6.2

## WearOS version

- AAPS 3.2 requires at least WearOS API level 28 (Android 9)

## Version 3.2.0.0 dedicated to @Philoul

Release date: 23-10-2023

### Important hints

- NS 15 is required
- While using websockets in NS v3 plugin treatments entered through NS UI (plus button) and other applications using v1 API are not sent to AAPS. This will be fixed in future release of NS. Always use the same client (v1 or v3) in AAPS and AAPSClient until NS fully switch to v3 internaly. The same is valid for AAPS and AAPSClient itself.
- Websockets in v3 plugin works similiar way to v1 plugin. Without websockets enabled AAPS schedules regularly downloads from NS which should lead to lower power consumption because NS is not permanently connected. On the oposite side it means delays in exchanging data. Please read [here](Important-comments-on-using-v3-versus-v1-API-for-Nightscout-with-AAPS) the important comments from the dev team before you use it!
- If you are using xdrip as cgm source you must select it again after update due to internal changes
- Tidepool can be used as a replacement of NS to pass first objective
- If you send to xDrip+ you must configure xDrip synchronization plugin. In order to receive BGs from AAPS in xDrip, “xDrip+ Sync Follower” must be selected as source
- If you want to switch to ComboV2 driver, Ruffy must be uninstalled and pump paired again to AAPS
- In order to use DynISF plugin you have to start Objective 11 (all previous must be in finished state to allow start of 11)

(Important-comments-on-using-v3-versus-v1-API-for-Nightscout-with-AAPS)=
### Important comments on using v3 versus v1 API for Nightscout with AAPS

v1 is the old protocol used for exchanging data between NS web site and NS server. It has many limitations
- v1 sends only 2 days of data
- v1 send all 2 days data on every reconnection
- using websockets is mandatory = permanent connection, more battery compsumption
- during frequent disconnects to NS connection is paused for 15 minutes to prevent high data usage

v3 is new protocol. More safe and efficient
- while using tokens you can better define access rights
- protocol is more efficient on both sides (AAPS & NS)
- It can read up to 3 months of data from NS
- you can choose to use or to not use websockets on every device (using means faster updates, not using means lower power compsumption, but slower updates ie. minutes)
- NSClient is not paused on disconnections

LIMITATIONS
- NS 15 must be used with AAPS 3.2
- v3 doesn't see updates done by v1 protocol (probably it will be resolved in some future version of NS)
- in opposite because of old uneffective method of tracking changes v1 see changes done by v3
- remember NS still uses v1 internaly so far thus is not possible to enter data through NS web UI if you are using v3. You must use AAPSClient on SMS if you want enter data remotely

RECOMMENDED SETTING
- because of all above you should choose only one method and use it on all devices (remember all other uploaders at time of writing this are using v1). If you decide to go to v3, select v3 in AAPS and all AAPSClients
- v3 is preffered because of efficiency
- using websockets or not using with v3 depends on your preference
- it HIGHLY recommended to let AAPS gather all data and then upload it to NS as a single uploader. All other devices/applications should only read from NS. By doing it you'll prevent conflicts and sync errors. This is valid for getting BG data to NS using Dexcom Share connector etc. too

## Version 3.1.0

Release date: 19-07-2022

## Version 3.0.0

Release date: 31-01-2022

(Releasenotes-important-hints-3-0-0)=
### Important hints

- **Minimum Android version is 9.0 now.**
- **Data is not migrated to new database.** Do not complain, it's so huge change so it's simply not possible. Thus after update IOB, COB, treatments etc. will be cleared. You have to create new [profile switch](../Usage/Profiles.md) and start with zero IOB and COB. Plan the update carefully!!! Best in situation without active insulin and carbs
- Use the same version of AAPS and NSClient

**Make sure to check and adjust settings after updating to 3.0 as described** [here](../Installing-AndroidAPS/update3_0.md).

### Preparation steps

**At least two days before update:**

- disable Dexcom bridge in Nightscout
- if you are using G5/G6 and xDrip as a collector, you have to update xDrip to a nightly version newer than 14th January 2022
- if you are using G5/G6 switching to BYODA as collector is recommended to take advantage of back-smoothing (you can still use xDrip for other purposes, xDrip can receive data from BYODA)

### Important hints

- Option **NS_UPLOAD_ONLY** has been forced ON for all 2.8.1 users.
- If you use NSClient to enter TT, carbs or profile switches you must turn it off in AAPS but **only in case your synchronization is working well** (ie. you don't see unwanted data changes like self modification of TT, TBR etc).

### Settings to adjust when switching from AMA to SMB

- Objective 10 must be started for SMBs to be enabled (SMB tab generally shows what restrictions apply)

- maxIOB now includes \_all\_ IOB, not just added basal. That is, if given a bolus of 8 U for a meal and maxIOB is 7 U, no SMBs will be delivered until IOB drops below 7 U.

- min_5m_carbimpact default has changed from 3 to 8 going from AMA to SMB. If you are upgrading from AMA to SMB, you have to change it manually

- Note when building AAPS 2.0 apk: Configuration on demand is not supported by the current version of the Android Gradle plugin! If your build fails with an error regarding "on demand configuration" you can do the following:

  - Open the Preferences window by clicking File > Settings (on Mac, Android Studio > Preferences).
  - In the left pane, click Build, Execution, Deployment > Compiler.
  - Uncheck the Configure on demand checkbox.
  - Click Apply or OK.

(Releasenotes-overview-tab)=

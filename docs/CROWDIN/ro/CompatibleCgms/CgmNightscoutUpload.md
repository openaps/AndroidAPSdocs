# Pentru utilizatorii de alte sisteme CGM încărcate în Nightscout

If you have any other CGM set up that can send your BG data **only** to [Nightscout](https://nightscout.github.io/).

```{important}
This data source will not work when you are offline, when you experience network issues or when your Nightscout site is down. Use with caution.
```

-   Setup NSClient with your Nightscout site information.
-   Select NSClient BG in [ConfigBuilder, BG Source](#Config-Builder-bg-source).

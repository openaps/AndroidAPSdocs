# Update to a new version or branch

## Build yourself instead of download

**AndroidAPS is not available as download due to regulation for medial devices. It is legal to build the app for your own use but you must not give a copy to others! See [FAQ page](../Getting-Started/FAQ.md) for details.**

## Important notes

* Please update as soon as possible after a new release is available. You will receive an [information on the AndroidAPS home screen](../Installing-AndroidAPS/Releasenotes#release-notes) about the new version.
* As of version 2.3 you have to use git to update. Updating via zip file does not work anymore.
* As of version 2.7 repository location changed to <https://github.com/nightscout/AndroidAPS>. If you are not familiar with git the easiest way for update is remove directory with AndroidAPS and do a [new clone](../Installing-AndroidAPS/Building-APK.md).
* Please use [Android Studio Version 4.0.1](https://developer.android.com/studio/) or newer to build the apk.
* [Windows 10 32-bit systems](../Installing-AndroidAPS/troubleshooting_androidstudio#unable-to-start-daemon-process) are not supported by Android Studio 4.0.1.
* If you are using xDrip make sure to [identify the receiver](../Configuration/xdrip#identify-receiver).
* If you are using Dexcom G6 with the [patched Dexcom app](../Hardware/DexcomG6#if-using-g6-with-patched-dexcom-app) you will need the version from the [2.4 folder](https://github.com/dexcomapp/dexcomapp/tree/master/2.4).

## Quick walk-through for experienced users

Please skip this paragraph if you update for the first time. The quick walk-through is for experienced users. Your next step would be to [install git](../Installing-AndroidAPS/git-install.rst) if you do not have it already.

If you already updated AAPS in previous versions and use a Windows PC you can update in four simple steps:

1. [Export your settings](../Usage/ExportImportSettings#how-to-export-settings) from the existing AAPS version on your phone to be on the save side
2. [Update local copy](../Installing-AndroidAPS/Update-to-new-version#update-your-local-copy) (VCS->Git->Pull)
3. [Generate signed APK](../Installing-AndroidAPS/Update-to-new-version#generate-signed-apk) (Select 'app' instead of 'wear' on your way!)
4. Depending on your [BG source](../Configuration/BG-Source.rst) make sure to [identify receiver](../Configuration/xdrip#identify-receiver) in xDrip or use the patched Dexcom app from the [2.4 folder](https://github.com/dexcomapp/dexcomapp/tree/master/2.4).

## Install git (if you don't have it)

Follow the manual on the [git installation page](../Installing-AndroidAPS/git-install.rst).

## Transfer APK to smartphone

Easiest way to transfer app-full-release.apk to your phone is via [USB cable or Google Drive](https://support.google.com/android/answer/9064445?hl=en). Please note that transfer by mail might cause difficulties and is not the preferred way.

On your phone you have to allow installation from unknown sources. Manuals how to do this can be found on the internet (i.e. [here](https://www.expressvpn.com/de/support/vpn-setup/enable-apk-installs-android/) or [here](https://www.androidcentral.com/unknown-sources)).

SMS Commands
**************************************************
Safety First
==================================================
* AndroidAPS allows you to control a child's phone remotely via text message. If you enable this SMS Communicator, always remember that the phone set up to give remote commands could be stolen. So always protect it at least by a PIN code. A strong password or biometrics are recommended.
* Additionally it is recommended to allow a `second phone number <#authorized-phone-numbers>`_ for SMS commands. So you can use second number to `temporary disable <#other>`_ SMS communicator in case your main remote phone gets lost or stolen.
* AndroidAPS will also inform you by text message if your remote commands, such as a bolus or a profile change, have been carried out. It is advisable to set this up so that confirmation texts are sent to at least two different phone numbers in case one of the receiving phones is stolen.
* **If you bolus through SMS Commands you must enter carbs through Nightscout (NSClient, Website...)!** If you fail to do so IOB would be correct with too low COB potentially leading to not performed correction bolus as AAPS assumes that you have too much active insulin.
* As of AndroidAPS version 2.7 an authenticator app with a time-based one-time password must be used to increase safety when using SMS commands.

Setup SMS commands
==================================================

* Most of the adjustments of temp targets, following AAPS etc. can be done on `NSClient app <../Children/Children.html>`_ on an Android phone with an internet connection.
* Boluses can't be given through Nightscout, but you can use SMS commands.
* If you use an iPhone as a follower and therefore cannot use NSClient app, there are additional SMS commands available.

* In your android phone setting go to Applications > AndroidAPS > Permissions and enable SMS

Authorized phone numbers
-------------------------------------------------
* In AndroidAPS go to **Preferences > SMS Communicator** and enter the phone number(s) that you will allow SMS commands to come from (separated by semicolons - i.e. +6412345678;+6412345679) 
* Enable 'Allow remote commands via SMS'.
* If you want to use more than one number:

  * Enter just one number.
  * Make that single number work by sending and confirming a SMS command.
  * Enter additional number(s) separated by semicolon, no space.

Minutes between bolus commands
-------------------------------------------------
* You can define the minimum delay between two boluses issued via SMS.
* For safety reasons you have to add at least two authorized phone numbers to edit this value.

Additionally mandatory PIN at token end
-------------------------------------------------
* For safety reasons the reply code must be followed by a PIN.
* PIN rules:

  * 3 to 6 digits
  * not same digits (i.e. 1111)
  * not in a row (i.e. 1234)

Authenticator setup
-------------------------------------------------
* Two-factor authentication is used to improve safety.
* You can use any Authenticator app that supports RFC 6238 TOTP tokens. Popular free apps are:

  * `Authy <https://authy.com/download/>`_
  * Google Authenticator - `Android <https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2>`_ / `iOS <https://apps.apple.com/de/app/google-authenticator/id388497605>`_
  * `LastPass Authenticator <https://lastpass.com/auth/>`_
  * `FreeOTP Authenticator <https://freeotp.github.io/>`_

* Install the authenticator app of your choice on your follower phone and scan the QR code shown in AAPS.
* Test the one-time password by entering the token shown in your authenticator app and the PIN you just setup in AAPS. Example:

  * Your mandatory PIN is 2020
  * TOTP token from the authenticator app is 457051
  * Enter 4570512020
   
* The red text "WRONG PIN" will change **automatically** to a green "OK" if the entry is correct. **There is no button you can press!**
* The time on both phones must be synchronized. Best practice is set automatically from network. Time differences might lead to authentication problems.
* Use button "RESET AUTHENTICATORS" if you want to remove provisioned authenticators.  (By resetting authenticator you make ALL already provisioned authenticators invalid. You will need to set them up again)

Use SMS commands
==================================================
* Send a SMS to the phone with AndroidAPS running from your approved phone number(s) using any of the `commands <../Children/SMS-Commands.html#commands>`_ below. 
* The AAPS phone will respond to confirm success of command or status requested. 
* Confirm command by sending the code where necessary. Example:

  * Your mandatory PIN is 2020
  * TOTP token from the authenticator app is 457051
  * Enter 4570512020

**Hint**: It can be useful to have unlimited SMS on your phone plan (for each phone used) if a lot of SMS will be sent.

Commands
==================================================
Commands must be sent in English, the response will be in your local language if the response string is already `translated <../translations.html#translate-strings-for-androidaps-app>`_.

Troubleshooting
==================================================
Multiple SMS
--------------------------------------------------
If you receive the same message over and over again (i.e. profile switch) you will probably have set up a circle with other apps. This could be xDrip+, for example. If so, please make sure that xDrip+ (or any other app) does not upload treatments to NS. 

If the other app is installed on multiple phones make sure to deactivate upload on all of them.

SMS commands not working on Samsung phones
--------------------------------------------------
There was a report on SMS commands stopping after an update on Galaxy S10 phone. Could be solved by disabling 'send as chat message'.

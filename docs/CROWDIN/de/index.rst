Welcome to the Android APS documentation
==============================================

**What is AndroidAPS?**

AndroidAPS is an app that can communicate with bluetooth-enabled insulin pumps, and runs a version of OpenAPS "oref0" algorithm.

**Primary goals behind AndroidAPS:**

* modular app where is possible to easy add new modules without touching the rest of code
* app that allow localization
* app where we can easy select what will be included in final apk just by easy change and compilation
* app which support open and closed APS mode
* app where you can see how APS works: input params, result and final decision
* allow to add more APS algorithms and let user decide what to use
* app independent to pump driver and containing "Virtual pump" to allow users safely play with APS
* app with tight Nightscout integration
* app where is possible easy to add/remove constraints for user safety
* all-in-one app you need for managing T1D with APS and Nightscout

**What you need to get started:**

* An Android Smartphone with Android 5.0 or later. See `this spreadsheet <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gZAsN6f0gv6tkgy9EBsYl0BQNhna0RDqA9QGycAqCQc/edit?usp=sharing>`_ for reports on how well a phone works with AndroidAPS.
* An app to receive CGM data: `xDrip <http://stephenblackwasalreadytaken.github.io/xDrip/>`_/ `xDrip+ <https://github.com/jamorham/xDrip-plus>`_, `Glimp <http://www.nightscout.info/wiki/welcome/nightscout-for-libre>`_ or `600SeriesAndroidUploader <https://github.com/pazaan/600SeriesAndroidUploader>`_
* `AndroidAPS <https://github.com/MilosKozak/AndroidAPS>`_ itself
* `Nightscout <https://github.com/nightscout/cgm-remote-monitor>`_ 0.10.2 or later
* A supported pump: Dana-R or Dana-RS Insulin Pump (unless you build your own driver for other insulin pump) or Accu-Chek Combo (currently in wider testing)
* A Continuous Glucose Monitor (CGM) data source: Dexcom G4/G5, Freestyle Libre, Eversense or Medtronic Guardian

# Sensitivity Detection and COB options

* Currently we have 3 sensitivity detection models 
  * Sensitivity Oref0
  * Sensitivity AAPS
  * Sensitivity WeightedAverage

### Sensitivity Oref0

Similiar to Oref0 described in [Oref0 documentation](https://openaps.readthedocs.io/en/2017-05-21/docs/walkthrough/phase-4/advanced-features.html). Basically sensitivity is calculated from 24h data in the past and carbs (if not absorbed) are cutted after time specified in preferences

### Sensitivity AAPS

Sensitivity is calculated the same way like Oref0 but you can specify time to the past. Minimal carbs absorption is calculated from max carbs absorption time from preferences

### Sensitivity WeightedAverage

Sensitivity is calculated as a weighted average from deviations. Newer deviations have higher weight. Minimal carbs absorption is calculated from max carbs absorption time from preferences. This algorithm is fastest in following sensitivity changes.

### COB Examples

Oref0 - unabsorbed carbs are cutted after specified time

AAPS, WeightedAverage - absorption is calculated to have `COB == 0` after specified time

If minimal carbs absorption is used instead of value calculated from deviations, a green dot appears on COB graph

# Phones

Users are creating a [list of tested phones and watches](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gZAsN6f0gv6tkgy9EBsYl0BQNhna0RDqA9QGycAqCQc/edit?usp=sharing)

You can use filters to display particular pumps or phones but please set back to view all when you've finished looking, ready for the next person to view all.

To record a phone or watch that isn't already listed in the spreadsheet then please fill in the [form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScvmuqLTZ7MizuFBoTyVCZXuDb__jnQawEvMYtnnT9RGY6QUw/viewform)

Any problems with the spreadsheet please email <hardware@androidaps.org>, any donations of phone/watch models that still need testing please email [donations@androidaps.org](mailto:hardware@androidaps.org).
